I really, really enjoyed *Barbarian Days*. William Finnegan has lived the sort of life that many people can only dream about. He's regularly surfed 10+ft waves for well over 40 years, travelled the world working hand to mouth and has experienced more in a lifetime than many of us will ever do and see.

*William Finnegan* is an addict. his life for decades revolved entirely around surfing and this addition took him across the world surfing in Hawaii, Indonesia, Fiji, Australia, South Africa, Madeira and more. There's also a distinct sense of growing maturity in the book, as Finnegan travels and experiences poverty and inequality first-hand, reaching a crescendo when he reaches apartheid ridden South Africa and takes up a job teaching black students.

Finnegan was lucky, in a number of ways. He grew up at a time where travel was relatively affordable, when income disparity wasn't what it is today and kitchen and manual labour jobs paid a decent wage, at least enough to get by on. Critically, this was a time before the internet, communication was neither cheap nor instantaneous. There was still a sense of etiquette within the surf community, who tried keeping their waves private to avoid crowds turning up. 

All this has changed now, and I don't think we'll ever see the like again. Finnegan laments the commercialisation of the sport, [Taravua](https://www.tavarua.com/) being turned into a resort and the wave he discovered being destroyed by building projects to attract tourists. There's a similar situation in Madeira, where development of [Jardim do Mar](https://www.savethewaves.org/jardim-do-mar-madeira/) turned the waves from a surfing mecca to something entirely too dangerous to attempt.

I was watching the [Andy Irons documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJWIPRvtAHk) on AP last night and was struck by how much things have changed in the surfing world from how Finnegan portrays it to the multi-billion dollar industry it is today. There's certainly an element of sadness to that.

After more than a year stuck in the UK, unable to travel. You can do a lot worse than live vicariously through Finnegan's story.
