*Game theory* is one of those concepts I've heard mentioned a few times but never really understood properly.

Unfortunately this book didn't really help. It quickly dives into concepts and uses poorly explained illustrations and definitions to support the material, adding more confusion to the text.

I'll continue looking for a book that explains these concepts well. For the time being, this ain't it.
