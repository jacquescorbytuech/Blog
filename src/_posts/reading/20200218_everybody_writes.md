Thanks to [Elliot](https://twitter.com/IAmElliot) for the reccomendation on this one!

I find writing hard, like, *really hard*, so this book was definitely something I needed to read.

I really enjoyed the way Ann writes clearly and succinctly about writing, with the first chunk of rules being no-brainers that nevertheless are hard to do consistently and ruthlessly. Speaking of rules, there are 74 in total.

I found some of the rules particularly useful:

* **Rule 23 - Avoid writing by committee** - I particularly liked Ann's advice to ask for approval rather than asking for suggestions when seeking sign-off on a piece of creative work. Applicable pretty much everywhere.
* **Rule 36 - Avoid these mistakes marketers make** - Stop trying to shoehorn in "professional" sounding words and instead aim to be clear in your writing. Think "Remains" rather than "continues to be".
* **Rule 38 - Learn words you're probably misusing or confusing with other words** - Disinterested and uninterested don't mean the same thing.

Some other things I found a little less useful. Knowing about Google Authorship in SERP's was useful in 2014, 6 years ago. It's not of any real relevance now. Of course, Ann couldn't predict the future when this book was published, but *rule 55* does mention "try to avoid anything older than four years, since it's likely to be stale".

Minor quibbles aside, and they are minor, this is a great reference book and a worthwhile purchase if you want to overcome your fear of writing.
