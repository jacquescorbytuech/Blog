This is the third book by Michael Lewis I've read this year, after [Flash Boys](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/flash-boys.html) and [The Fifth Risk](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/the-fifth-risk.html).

Like the other books, *Boomerang* is hugely engaging and explains in simple layman's terms what happened in Iceland, Greece, Ireland and other countries that were particularly affected by the global financial meltdown in '08.

Definitely worth a read if you want to understand how everything started going wrong.

But hey, everything's different now the money print goes brrr, right?

Right?
