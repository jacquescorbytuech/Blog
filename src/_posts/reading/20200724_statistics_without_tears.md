I forgotten more GCSE and AS level stats than I care to mention so starting again from the ground up felt like the right thing to do.

This book starts from the very basics, explaining what a sample is and how one can be collected, statistical variables, the different types of average, normal distribution, standard deviation, etc.

Marketing is a career where a degree of data literacy is critical to being generally competent at your job (although you can certainly get far by pretending to understand). You'll do yourself and your colleagues a favour if you read this book.
