I've been aware of the [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/) blog for a number of years now but always found it fairly impenetrable.

This was a fairly good intro to the general concept of *mental models*, but felt fairly light if you've ever read anything vaguely approaching this subject.

The book can be roughly broken down into the following concepts:

1. **The Map is not the Territory** - The description of the thing is not the thing itself.
2. **Circle of Competence** - The subject area that matches your skills or expertise.
3. **Inversion** - Approaching a situation from the opposite end.
4. **Occam’s Razor** - Something simple is more likely to be true than something complex.
5. **Hanlon’s Razor** - Don't attribute to malice that which is more easily explained by stupidity.

There's a few more but those are what stood out to me.

> Successfully thinking in shades of probability means roughly identifying what matters, coming up with a sense of the odds, doing a check on our assumptions, and then making a decision. We can act with a higher level of certainty in complex, unpredictable situations.

Nothing earthshakingly revelatory here, but an enjoyable read nevertheless.
