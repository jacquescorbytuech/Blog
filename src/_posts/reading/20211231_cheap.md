Cheap is a fantastic look at modern consumer culture and how we got here.

Society is addicted to low-cost goods, but that comes at a very real cost, to society, to the environment and to our own futures.

> Discounters gave the common man and woman the opportunity to eschew the cobbler and the darning needle, to break in a brand-new pair of shoes or socks when their toes poked through the old ones. Discounters made ordinary folks feel rich by putting a wide selection of goods within easy reach of all but the most meager budgets. Someone had to pay, of course, but that someone need not be the customer.

Give this a read and think about it next time you reach for discount goods on Amazon.
