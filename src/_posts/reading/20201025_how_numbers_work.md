Pretty much exactly what it says on the cover. *How Numbers Work* is an interesting look at the history mathematical rules and some of the special numbers used
in modern mathematics such as zero, pi, e and infinity.

It's a shame I didn't read this when I was much younger as I think it'd have made me more interested in maths and more likely to study it in a more serious manner at school. All I can do now is play catch up and read about things like the [empty set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empty_set) that I wish I'd been taught in my early 'teens.

> The late physicist John Wheeler said that ‘the basis of all mathematics is 0 = 0’, referring to the idea that all mathematical structures can be derived from something called ‘the empty set’, the set that contains no elements
