I'm not sure that I can give adequate voice to just how good *Invisible Women* is.

This is an incredibly powerful book that highlights just how unequal modern society is and what we should be trying to do to change.

For too many years women have suffered from decisions made to suit men. Medicines designed around the *"average man"* that don't work on or cause harm to women, products designed for male proportions that cause harm and injury to women, countless decisions based on male thinking to suit male objectives that inconvenience or otherwise harm women's daily life.

If you're not throwing your hands up at the injustice of the world throughout this book, I don't know what's wrong with you.
