This one felt like a waste of time. The general topic is an interesting one, that is, solve the root cause of a problem rather than the problem as it pops up. Sadly the execution left a lot to be desired.

There are a few interesting anecdotes sprinkled in here and there but you're unlikely to learn anything revelatory.

Don't waste your money on this.
