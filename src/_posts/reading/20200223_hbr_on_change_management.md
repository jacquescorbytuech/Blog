I recently read [HBR's 10 Must Reads on Communication](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/hbr-10-reads-on-communication.html), unfortunately this one was rather disappointing in comparison.

This book is part of Harvard Business Review's *10 Must Reads* series and highlights 10 of the best essays and articles on Change Management published in HBR over the years. I'm shocked if this was the best they could find as I can only describe this collection as lacklustre.

The only real standout was *Radical Change, the Quiet Way* by Debra E. Meyerson, which describes how *Tempered Radicals* can push through organisational change via 4 simple tactics:

1. **Disruptive Self-Expression** - making yourself into a positive talking point in the office through differentiation from the status quo
2. **Verbal Jujitsu** - *(what is it with consultants and confrontational fetishism?)* redirecting negative statements and actions into positive change
3. **Variable-Term Opportunism** - Look towards the long-term but don't be afraid to capitalise on short-term opportunities when they present themselves
4. **Strategic Alliance Building** - Work with allies, learn from opponents in the organisation to deliver change.

This is really the only article worth reading out of the 10 in this book, so [read it online](https://hbr.org/2001/10/radical-change-the-quiet-way) instead.
