Having read and thoroughly enjoyed [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/thinking-fast-and-slow) by Kahneman back in 2020 I was expecting good things from this. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver.

This is one of those books that would have been better served as a 2,000 word blog post, instead it's a ~450 page bore.

TL;DR don't waste your time on this.
