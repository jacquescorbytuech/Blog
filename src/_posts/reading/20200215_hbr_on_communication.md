Harvard Business Review's *10 Must Reads* series highlights ten of the best articles posted on Harvard Business Review on a specific topic. *On Communication* seemed like a fairly interesting one and it didn't entirely disappoint.

Specifically, four of the ten articles are absolutely worth a read.

***The Necessary Art of Persuasion*** by *Jay A. Conger* is exactly what it sounds like â€” covering different methods of framing a conversation to try persuade someone that your cause/goal/whatever is worthy. It's something I often struggle with in a professional setting so was absolutely worth the read for me, although highlighting Microsoft's [BOB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob) as one of the case studies really shows the article's age.

***Is Silence Killing Your Company*** by *Leslie Perlow* and *Stephanie Williams* is what I'd consider a *must-read*, which highlight how failures to communicate can kill productivity and morale within a company. If you read anything in this book, read this one. [Or read it online](https://hbr.org/2003/05/is-silence-killing-your-company).

***Telling Tales*** by *Stephen Denning* was interesting, highlighting the value of storytelling and when to use a narrative to highlight successes or failures that can be learnt from.

Finally ***How to Pitch a Brilliant Idea*** by *Kimberly D. Elsbach* is about different strategies one can use to pitch an idea, with advice for both the pitcher and the catcher (the recipient of the pitch).

Put these articles together and I think you can learn a lot about how to communicate effectively, both within a business setting but more broadly in your every day life as well.

You don't have to buy the book, but I'd absolutely recommend reading the four articles highlighted above if you can. Links below for your convenience.
