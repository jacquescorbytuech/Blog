Another surfer biography, which seemed interesting after reading [Barbarian Days](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/barbarian-days) earlier this year.

You've probably seen photos of Garrett McNamara over the years, usually seen surfing [building-sized waves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58a9xYOweU8) or being towed behind a jet-ski.

This book leans towards the spiritual which isn't my particular cup of tea but you can see how, after his wild childhood, McNamara would end up that way. 

*Hound of the Sea* is a great window into the mind of a surfer who's always looking for the next big wave. Fascinating at turns but perhaps less interesting in its single minded pursuit compared with Barbarian Days.
