Man, Phil Knight does *not* come across as likeable in this at all.

Admirable, yes, absolutely, and maybe that's why Shoe Dog is such a compelling read. I knew less than nothing about the history of Nike before picking this up, but in a short ~400 pages Phil Knight introduces the cast and the events that turned the business into the $113 billion behemoth it is today.

What I found interesting about *Shoe Dog* was how it explored Phil's growing maturity, which seemed to march in lockstep with Nike's success. He's deeply self-critical and doesn't gloss over his numerous mistakes and failures. Very refreshing in a business memoir.

Maybe don't marry your students though...
