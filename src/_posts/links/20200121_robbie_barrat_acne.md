It would be hard to argue that Robbie Barrat isn't a pioneer.

At the age of 20 he's already [written code](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18013190/ai-art-portrait-auction-christies-belamy-obvious-robbie-barrat-gans) that was instrumental in the creation and subsequent sale of the world's first (and still, most expensive) piece of AI art sold at auction, which went for $432,500 (rewarded to a French team who *"borrowed"* Robbie's code).

He's also [collaborated](https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/1/22/ai-artist-robbie-barrat-and-painter-ronan-barrot-collaborate-on-infinite-skulls) with painter Ronan Barrot, [trained a Machine Learning algorithm](https://robbiebarrat.github.io/balenciaga.html) on Balenciaga runway shows, going on to [make and sell trousers](https://itemlabel.com/products/shinbag-pants-robbie-barrat-x-itemlabel?variant=14687923961898) inspired by the output of the subsequent model.

Most recently, he's collaborated with the fashion label Acne studios on their A/W20 menswear collection, using neural networks to generate new designs based on Acne's back catalogue, which were unveiled at Paris Fashion Week last Sunday.

I can't wait to see what Robbie does next!
