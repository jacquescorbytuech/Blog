A great look behind the scenes into Gregory Crewdson's design process when working on a soundstage. In this case from one of the photos in [Beneath the Roses](https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2005/gregory-crewdson-beneath-the-roses/).

> For me, though the real reason to shoot on a soundstage is the control it gives us over the light. Because there are no ceilings, and flats rather than walls, Rick Sands, my director of photography, has enormous freedom with where he places the lights. On location, one of the things that makes me most nervous and aggitated is wind and weather. I canâ€™t control it, and it often controls our production.

I can't recommend enough going to see one of Crewdson's exhibitions if you ever get the opportunity.
