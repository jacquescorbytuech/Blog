While I don't agree with the malware paranoia, this one by Mike Ludo seems like a no-brainer.

Sadly one that often falls on deaf ears.

> All of this spam production is a drain on a companyâ€™s resources that could be put into simply designing better product. Not that I want to advocate the mass firings of low-paid English majors, marketing interns, or whoever else is writing this deletia, but take every penny you are putting into spamming someone who once gave you their email address into making your product better, and you will reap the rewards as will everyone else on the planet who has an inbox.
