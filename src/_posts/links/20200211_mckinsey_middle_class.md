The loss of the middle class should concern all of us, with Mckinsey and their ilk (Bain and BCG) responsible for decimating the middle class workforce while simultaneously creating more demand for their own services.

> Management consultants insist that meritocracy required the restructuring that they encouraged—that, as Kiechel put it dryly, “we are not all in this together; some pigs are smarter than other pigs and deserve more money.” Consultants seek, in this way, to legitimate both the job cuts and the explosion of elite pay. Properly understood, the corporate reorganizations were, then, not merely technocratic but ideological. Rather than simply improving management, to make American corporations lean and fit, they fostered hierarchy, making management, in David Gordon’s memorable phrase, “fat and mean.”

Worth a read if only to understand the precarious position society finds itself in as a result of income inequalities.
