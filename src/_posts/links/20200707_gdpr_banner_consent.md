Some fantastic, albeit unsurprising research from Marko Saric on how many website visitors will give a GDPR compliant level of consent to being tracked by a marketing analytics tool.

> If you implement a proper GDPR consent banner, a vast majority of visitors will most probably decline to give you consent. 91% to be exact out of 19,000 visitors in my study.

That's a marked difference from the  > 90% opt-in rate [claimed by Quantcast](https://martechtoday.com/quantcast-reports-more-than-90-of-visitors-to-eu-domains-grant-gdpr-consent-219462). Admittedly, most implementations of their tool are themselves, [falling short of being compliant with the regulations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02479.pdf) or ignoring [existing guidance from the ICO](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/digital-marketing-post-gdpr).
