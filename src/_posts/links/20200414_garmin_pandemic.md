The folks at Garmin published some interesting data looking at people's exercise habits through the ongoing COVID19 pandemic.

> While the decrease in global movement scratches the surface of what’s happening, the advanced metrics in millions of Garmin wearable devices give us a deeper understanding of exactly how people are dealing with the impact of the pandemic on their active lifestyles. We’re observing a remarkable shift in the types of activities people are doing, reflecting an unprecedented about-face when it comes to typical springtime exercise and activity.

Unsurprisingly, we're seeing a marked shift in how people exercise, with a general decrease in daily activity but with a marked increase in sports like yoga or virtual training sessions using apps like Zwift.
