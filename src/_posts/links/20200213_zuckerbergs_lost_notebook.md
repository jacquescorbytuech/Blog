Fantastic article from Wired telling the story of Mark Zuckerberg's notebooking habit, and some of the key facts about early Facebook that have emerged.

> In 2010, it introduced Instant Personalization, a privacy-busting feature that gave more personal information to outside app developers. Time and again, over internal objections, Zuckerberg chose growth and competitive advantage over caution and privacy-consciousness. The result was a series of hasty apologies, not to mention charges and a $5 billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission.
