An interesting study from the Review of Managerial Science which looks at gaming performance and it's potential correlation with real world problem solving performance.

> Under controlled laboratory conditions, we asked forty business students to play the Civilization game and to participate in a series of assessment exercises. We find that students who had high scores in the game had better skills related to problem-solving and organizing and planning than the students who had low scores.

Maybe a gaming session should be part of the interview process for manager-level roles?
