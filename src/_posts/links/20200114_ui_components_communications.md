This might be blasphemy coming from someone who's worked in email marketing as long as I have, but there's more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to communicating with your app's customers.

I love how this article breaks down these channels by the amount of friction they create for customers. High friction isn't necessarily a bad thing, you just need to be aware of what you're doing and what you're trying to achieve.
