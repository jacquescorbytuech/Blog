Last year I had the chance to attend a training course on the art of good customer service, taught by the folks at [Hamilton Mercer](https://hamiltonmercer.co.uk/).

This course was primarily for the benefit of our Customer Experience team, however, I thought it might be appropriate for my attendance for two reasons:

1. I wanted to gain a better understanding of what we're trying to deliver from a Customer Service perspective. Doing so would help me gain insights into potential opportunities for new internal processes and where we might have shortcomings with our tooling.
2. I wanted to improve the quality of the customer service the Revenue Operations department is delivering into the wider business. We have a lot of internal customers[^customers] so it's key that we're able to work effectively with them and deliver what they need.

The course was laid out over the following modules:

* Service Culture: Vision, Philosophy & Responsibilities
* Defining Service Standards
* Service-Focused Communication Skills
* Structuring Difficult Conversations

Notes taken from the course and thoughts about how to apply this from a general RevOps perspective follows below.

## Service Culture: Vision, Philosophy & Responsibilities

The first module tackled the key areas in defining the service culture for the business.

That is; defining a common service language, service principles and creating a seamless customer experience.

### Defining a Common Service Language

One of the foundational principles to keep in mind is that it's absolutely critical for communication to be *clear*, *understandable* and *consistent*.

**Consistency is the goal. Complexity is to be avoided.**

You'll frequently find that if you ask someone what *good* customer service looks like, they'll use common cliches like "going the extra mile" or "going above and beyond". These are not necessarily wrong, however, there's a large interpretation gap that exists when one person's *extra mile* is another person's *average*.

In practical terms, what you have to work to define are the key behaviours and the mindset that's required to deliver exceptional service and ensuring your team have the training, tools and support in place to consistently be able to deliver great service.

In RevOps terms, you'll broadly find that incoming requests fall into the following two categories. Requests and Bug Reports

One thing to keep in mind is to avoid negative priming language when dealing with a customer. That's things like *"Unfortunately..."* or *"I'm afraid that.."*. Basically, avoid priming your customer to feel negative thoughts regarding a specific situation.

Defining this new language is **not** about introducing new jargon or buzzwords into an org.

### Service Principles

There are three key principles to keep in mind when dealing with a customer:

1. From a factual perspective, the customer is **not** always right
2. The customer's perception is their reality
3. Never reduce the quality of service based on the customer's attitude or behaviour

### Creating a Seamless Customer Experience

## Defining Service Standards
## Service-Focused Communication Skills
## Structuring Difficult Conversations

[^customers]: In the context of Revenue Operations our customers tend to be the Marketing, Sales and Customer Success teams, however, I also find myself frequently working with and for Product, Data and Engineering teams.
