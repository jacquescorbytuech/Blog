I was reading some articles on the [Zettlekasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/zettelkasten-improves-thinking-writing/) of note keeping last week and wanted to give it a try.

After a bit of investigation into various tools, mostly stuff like Roam research, various VS Code extensions, etc, I settled on a markdown editor called Zettlr.

Zettlr isn't just a nice markdown editor (and it is very nice to write in), but it's got some great functionality to help you manage your notes.

You can:

* Add tags to your notes to help sort and categorise them
* Interlink notes using wiki style link markup ``[[Links]]``
* Add numeric ID's to files to facilitate linking so you can change the name of the note as it evolves without breaking links
* Sync your markdown files to git so they're available everywhere
* Customise the app using CSS
* Export notes in file formats like Word, PDF, HTML, etc

There's a whole bunch more functionality that I've not delved into yet, like an integrated pomodoro timer, word count targets, virtual projects, citation tools, etc.

Here's a quick look at what the interface looks like after using it for ~1 week.

Oh, and it's open source.

There's no reason not to [give it a try](https://www.zettlr.com/).
