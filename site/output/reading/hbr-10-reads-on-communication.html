  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Harvard Business Review's <em>10 Must Reads</em> series highlights ten of the best articles posted on Harvard Business Review on a specific topic. <em>On Communication</em> seemed like a fairly interesting one and it didn't entirely disappoint.</p>
<p>Specifically, four of the ten articles are absolutely worth a read.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Necessary Art of Persuasion</em></strong> by <em>Jay A. Conger</em> is exactly what it sounds like â€” covering different methods of framing a conversation to try persuade someone that your cause/goal/whatever is worthy. It's something I often struggle with in a professional setting so was absolutely worth the read for me, although highlighting Microsoft's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bob">BOB</a> as one of the case studies really shows the article's age.</p>
<p><strong><em>Is Silence Killing Your Company</em></strong> by <em>Leslie Perlow</em> and <em>Stephanie Williams</em> is what I'd consider a <em>must-read</em>, which highlight how failures to communicate can kill productivity and morale within a company. If you read anything in this book, read this one. <a href="https://hbr.org/2003/05/is-silence-killing-your-company">Or read it online</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Telling Tales</em></strong> by <em>Stephen Denning</em> was interesting, highlighting the value of storytelling and when to use a narrative to highlight successes or failures that can be learnt from.</p>
<p>Finally <strong><em>How to Pitch a Brilliant Idea</em></strong> by <em>Kimberly D. Elsbach</em> is about different strategies one can use to pitch an idea, with advice for both the pitcher and the catcher (the recipient of the pitch).</p>
<p>Put these articles together and I think you can learn a lot about how to communicate effectively, both within a business setting but more broadly in your every day life as well.</p>
<p>You don't have to buy the book, but I'd absolutely recommend reading the four articles highlighted above if you can. Links below for your convenience.</p>
