    <p>Anchoring, Priming, the Halo Effect, Loss Aversion, the Endowment Effect; if you work in marketing, these are likely all concepts you've heard about and have some degree of familiarity with, but how do they work and why?</p>
<p>This is another one I don't know why I left so late to read, weighing in at a mere ~400 pages <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em> explains some of the key concepts that makes our brains tick. </p>
<p>It also serves as a fantastic introduction to unconscious processing and the different systems at work in decision making.</p>
<p>Knowing these things can be used for good, as in knowing how to phrase something to help someone, or it can be used for ill, as in helping to convince people to buy shit they don't need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely worth reading this back to back and taking extensive notes.</p>
