  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This week's been pretty productive on the book reading front, I quickly worked my way through Orwell's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24104049-why-i-write">Why I Write</a> which was fascinating, albeit the British stereotyping quickly became tiresome. I found it interesting to compare Orwell's views on British and European values and the rise of fascism across Europe - things that worryingly have been on the rise in recent years.</p>
<p>I first came across Yanis Varoufakis' work back when he <a href="http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/">worked at Valve</a>, the video game company (back when they still made games) and thoroughly enjoyed the few blogs he posted there. So when I was browsing the Economics section of Waterstones I was drawn to his book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39808472-talking-to-my-daughter">A Brief History of Capitalism</a>. I know next to nothing in economics, so this was precisely the dumbed down view I needed to dip my toe into the subject.</p>
<p>I've heard and read a lot about Eric Ries' <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12969026-the-lean-startup">Lean Startup</a> in the last few years, so it provided some interesting and rather light reading when I was abroad in Granada. I'm working on a lil' something something so there was a lot to take away from this, particularly around the value of quickly developing and testing an MVP, something I hope to have done by the end of the year ðŸ‘€</p>
<p>Finally, I'm now reading Scott Galloway's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36166396-the-four">The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google</a>. More thoughts to follow next week.</p>
<p>Profitwell continue to bring out some of the most well-researched and produced content out there, and <a href="https://www.profitwell.com/blog/how-do-discounts-impact-growth">this piece on discounting</a> certainly didn't disappoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discounts are one of the worst tactics you can use to grow your business, because like a virus theyâ€™re a ticking time bomb for your growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite what you've read elsewhere, and what you're probably thinking, <a href="https://going-medieval.com/2019/08/02/i-assure-you-medieval-people-bathed/">medieval people bathed</a>, as Dr Eleanor Janega explains quite authoritatively. Not quite the smelly peasants we think about, eh?</p>
<p>This is something I'm sure a lot of people working in tech have come across, but what actually are product teams? Marty Cagan puts together a compelling case to explain the difference between <a href="https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/">product and feature teams</a>.</p>
<p>There was a great article in the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/16/superfans-a-love-story">New Yorker</a> on what modern fandom means and how it came to be. Not going to lie, superfans weird me out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-voter-data">Boris is trying to fuck us</a>. Is the ICO going to come to our <a href="https://twitter.com/ICOnews/status/1172085036012711936">rescue</a>?</p>
<p>We've all come across poorly implemented browser Push notifications, but it doesn't have to be that way Stephanie Walker wrote the perfect guide on <a href="https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-not-fck-up-push-notifications/">how to not fuck up push notifications</a>. Speaking anecdotally, my team at DM Companies implemented these on one of the sites we worked on. For our use case, we saw a consistent uplift vs the same message delivered via email. This is absolutely a channel that can work dramatically well, just be responsible with it, duh.</p>
<p>Bit short this week huh? I spent a long weekend in Granada - the Alhambra is fucking incredible. Get your head away from your screen and go visit sometime.</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
