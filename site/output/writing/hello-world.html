    <p>So, it's been a <strong>long</strong> time since I've bothered to have a blog or personal site of any sort - and while I've certainly dabbled in a bunch of web related projects over the years (mostly wikis and video game community related stuff), I've not really <em>done</em> the web properly in a long time.</p>
<p>I guess this represents a new start of sorts. I'm currently dabbling in Python in an effort to learn some new skills, so this site is being generated through <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com" title="Pelican">Pelican</a>, a Python based static site generator. I'm also experimenting with Github, something that seems trivial to most developers but I never got around to learning for no good reason at all. Site content is being hosted in an Azure blob, which is easy peasy through VS Code. </p>
<p>Ultimately I'd like become more rounded as a marketer by being able to actually get stuck in with some of the more technical projects that I like being involved in. I guess I'll be posting some of my efforts about that here, along with whatever else takes my fancy.</p>
<p>Thanks for dropping in!</p>
