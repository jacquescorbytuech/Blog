  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>So, it&#8217;s been a <strong>long</strong> time since I&#8217;ve bothered to have a blog or personal site of any sort - and while I&#8217;ve certainly dabbled in a bunch of web related projects over the years (mostly wikis and video game community related stuff), I&#8217;ve not really <em>done</em> the web properly in a long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>I guess this represents a new start of sorts. I&#8217;m currently dabbling in Python in an effort to learn some new skills, so this site is being generated through <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com" title="Pelican">Pelican</a>, a Python based static site generator. I&#8217;m also experimenting with Github, something that seems trivial to most developers but I never got around to learning for no good reason at all. Site content is being hosted in an Azure blob, which is easy peasy through <span class="caps">VS</span>&nbsp;Code. </p>
<p>Ultimately I&#8217;d like become more rounded as a marketer by being able to actually get stuck in with some of the more technical projects that I like being involved in. I guess I&#8217;ll be posting some of my efforts about that here, along with whatever else takes my&nbsp;fancy.</p>
<p>Thanks for dropping&nbsp;in!</p>
