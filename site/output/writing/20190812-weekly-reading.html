  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>This week&#8217;s been a good week, I was in Provence enjoying some much needed sunshine and rosÃ© and catching up on some&nbsp;reading.</p>
<p>First things first, I <em>finally</em> finished <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7203544-the-inheritance-of-rome">The Inheritance of Rome</a> which I&#8217;ve been reading since early July. I&#8217;m not normally this slow at getting through a book, but this was one hell of an information-dense read. It&#8217;s fascinating to see how the foundations of our modern world were set through this early Middle Ages period. It&#8217;s a shame Ibn Hawqal&#8217;s book on Sicilian idiocy has been lost to time, if only for the sheer pettiness of the&nbsp;author.</p>
<p>Also finished was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2595.Marketing_Warfare">Marketing Warfare</a> by Al Ries which while interesting, I can&#8217;t help but feel like the military anecdotes are a little trite. There&#8217;s definitely a lot to unpack in there, and I found it helpful to have more strategic principles detailed in such a clear way. While the author ascribes these as marketing challenges (and maybe they were when this was published in &#8216;85) it seems like business has changed and the challenges outlined are more to do with company strategy as opposed to pure marketing&nbsp;strategy.</p>
<p>That leaves me with Henry Kissinger&#8217;s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14799927-on-china">On China</a> which I&#8217;m ~80% through - more on that next&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>In other news I had plenty of time to catch up on some more general reading, more on which&nbsp;below.</p>
<p>Firstly, it seems like some positive news regarding Facebook, in as much as <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/749474600/users-can-sue-facebook-over-facial-recognition-software-court-rules?t=1566139785117">a court has decided that users can sue over their use of facial recognition technology</a>. Unsurprisingly, that&#8217;s not the only issue they&#8217;re facing this week with new information coming to light about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio">potentially sensitive user audio being listened to by human contractors</a> and Facebook employing some <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/technology/facebook-antitrust.html">defensive warfare</a> (See, I learnt something from that book) following a resurgence in calls for the company to be broken up by <span class="caps">US</span>&nbsp;regulators.</p>
<p>It seems like Facebook aren&#8217;t the only ones in hot water over creepy facial recognition tech, unknown to pretty much everyone, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42d087fa-bf79-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722">King&#8217;s Cross station was using the technology too</a> and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/major-breach-found-in-biometrics-system-used-by-banks-uk-police-and-defence-firms">major breach</a> has been found in Biostar 2&#8217;s systems, with more than a million people compromised.&nbsp;ðŸ™ƒ</p>
<p>If you hadn&#8217;t already noticed, the world&#8217;s falling apart. Mass tourism is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-12/tourism-is-overwhelming-the-world-s-top-destinations">creating issues</a> (to put it lightly) in popular holiday spots and <a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/08/potable-water-safe-to-drink-cities-global-south-drought-data/595966/">water</a> and <a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/opinion/why-new-york-city-needs-universal-internet-access.html">internet</a> access in cities continues to be inadequate and only getting worse as demand continues to increase without adequate infrastructural investment. Germany appears to be entertaining some interesting ideas on a potential <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/11/20798683/meat-sin-tax-climate-change-animal-welfare-germany">&#8220;sin tax&#8221; on eating meat</a>, it certainly seems like something worth considering given the ecological impact of animal&nbsp;husbandry. </p>
<p>As if the climate weren&#8217;t a big deal, Nike seems to think there&#8217;s a need for a <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/12/business/nike-sneaker-subscription/index.html">subscription service</a> giving kids 4 to 12 pairs of shoes a year. Given the crucial importance of <a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1670729/the-importance-of-clothing-resale-to-sustainable-fashion-in-2019/">decreasing the environmental impact of our fashion purchases</a>, this seems like a particularly meaningful kick in the teeth from a company that pretends towards left-leaning&nbsp;ideology.</p>
<p>And if all that wasn&#8217;t bad enough, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/17/plastic-recycling-myth-what-really-happens-your-rubbish">recycling might not be as green as we all like to tell ourselves</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733319301234#!">New research</a> has been published exporing some of the issues in ensuring low-skilled workers benefit from increasing investment in high-tech jobs in Britain. Citylab has an <a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/08/technology-employment-multiplier-effect-inequality-research/595291/">excellent breakdown</a> on this issue. Unsurprisingly, it&#8217;s not all sunshine and&nbsp;rainbows.</p>
<p>Maybe we (as in the British) are <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/13/the-world-is-reaping-the-chaos-the-british-empire-sowed/">to blame</a> for everything that&#8217;s going&nbsp;wrong?</p>
<p>The Atlantic has a great article on the <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/arrogance-anthropocene/595795/">Anthropocene and human arrogance</a>, it&#8217;s well worth a&nbsp;read.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>The idea of the Anthropocene inflates our own importance by promising eternal geological life to our creations. It is of a thread with our speciesâ€™ peculiar, self-styled exceptionalismâ€”from the animal kingdom, from nature, from the systems that govern it, and from time itself. This illusion may, in the long run, get us all&nbsp;killed.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about modern Russia, I&#8217;m going to have to find some good books to read in the near future to understand why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/10/thousands-march-in-moscow-disqualification-city-elections">events like this</a> are&nbsp;happening.</p>
<p>If, like me, you have more than a passing interest in tattoos, Artsy have a great article on <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-japanese-prints-inspired-tattoo-frenzy">Utagawa Kuniyoshi&#8217;s influence</a> on Japanese&nbsp;tattooing. </p>
<p>Conventional thinking tells us that a good <span class="caps">UX</span> is one in which the number of clicks the user makes is minimised. But sometimes, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-should-forget-about-the-number-of-clicks-b80532475fae">that just ain&#8217;t right</a>. Maybe the problem is we&#8217;re all used to <a href="https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/">generic, formulaic thinking</a>.</p>
<p>Quartz published an excellent article on some of the <a href="https://qz.com/1657890/this-is-how-shopping-sites-trick-you-for-money-and-info/">dark patterns</a> we employ on ecommerce and similar sites. I get it, we use dark patterns because they work, but at some point we need to think about the moral and societal repercussions of our&nbsp;work.</p>
<p><strong>In brighter news</strong>, two new experimental <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/health/ebola-outbreak-cure.html">treatments for Ebola</a> are working well enough that they will now be offered to all patients in the <span class="caps">DRC</span>.</p>
<p>Jason Bailey&#8217;s Artnome project has been on my radar for a couple years, this recent article showcases the <a href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/7/24/generative-portraiture-of-espen-kluge">artwork of Espen Kluge</a>, a Norwegian artist who uses generative algorithms to create abstract portraits. His work&#8217;s both visually gorgeous and technically&nbsp;fascinating.</p>
