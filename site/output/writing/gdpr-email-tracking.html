    <p><strong>The email industry&#8217;s got a <span class="caps">GDPR</span>&nbsp;problem.</strong></p>
<p>Some of you reading this might have seen me talk about this problem in the very excellent <a href="https://email.geeks.chat">Email Geeks Community</a>, but if you&#8217;re new, let me break it down for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Last year, the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> came into effect, which put in place some rigorous laws around data processing and how personally identifiable information (<span class="caps">PII</span>) has to be handled. This stressed out a lot of email marketers, who quite rightly realised that the new regulations would have a significant effect on their ability to acquire and market to customers via their email address (which counts as <span class="caps">PII</span>). </p>
<p>Now if you&#8217;re reading this, you&#8217;re probably familiar with how that&#8217;s gone, so I won&#8217;t bore you with the&nbsp;details.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>So What&#8217;s the&nbsp;Problem?</h2>
<p>The overwhelming majority of commercial email sent today contains tracking pixels and tracking links, these are used to uniquely identify individuals so that opens and clicks can be correctly attributed to. This isn&#8217;t strictly a problem, the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> does not ban processing of personal data for tracking purposes, however email tracking fails to meet a number of criteria necessary to be legal under the <span class="caps">GDPR</span>.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;re not collection consent to track user behaviour</strong> - That means we&#8217;re probably relying on good old Legitimate Interest and that&#8217;s frought with a number of&nbsp;risks.</p>
<p>Firstly, most brands aren&#8217;t disclosing in their privacy policies that they&#8217;re tracking user behaviour in marketing emails. That&#8217;s a problem. <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/">Article 5</a> clearly states that to be legally compliant, personal data should be processed in the following&nbsp;manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and&nbsp;transparency’);</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is further expanded upon in <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-39/">Recital 39</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be&nbsp;processed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Failure to adequately disclose email tracking within your brand&#8217;s privacy policy is a clear breach of the&nbsp;regulation.</p>
<p>Secondly, when Legitimate Interest is used as the legal basis for processing of personal data, the data subject has the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/">Right to Object</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those&nbsp;provisions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that when processing data under a Legitimate Interest basis, the data subject has the right to object to your tracking, this brings us round to our second&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Email Marketing Platforms Are Not <span class="caps">GDPR</span>&nbsp;Compliant&#8224;</h2>
<p>Take a look at your <span class="caps">ESP</span>, does it allow you to, on a per individual basis, opt-out of email&nbsp;tracking?</p>
<p>If the answer to that is no, and in most cases the answer will be no, you&#8217;re in breach of the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> as soon as a customer objects to your data processing. That is assuming you disclose the tracking in your privacy policy, if you don&#8217;t you&#8217;re already in&nbsp;breach.</p>
<p>This becomes even more of a legal quagmire as soon as we start looking at tracking in emails sent on a legal basis other than Consent or Legitimate Interest. 
So what can you do about&nbsp;it?</p>
<p><strong>Complain to your <span class="caps">ESP</span>!</strong> Complain frequently and loudly. Make them do something about it. Ultimately the <span class="caps">GDPR</span> is here to stay, and <span class="caps">ESP</span>&#8217;s must put in the work to allow marketers to comply with the&nbsp;law.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h2>Where Does That Leave Email&nbsp;Marketing?</h2>
<p>Email marketing isn&#8217;t going anywhere, email remains one of the most valuable channels for reaching your customers and losing the ability to track behavioural data isn&#8217;t going to change that fundamental fact. What is going to change is our ability to act upon vast swathes of personal&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>You know&nbsp;what?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not a problem, personal data is not a crucial part of gauging the success of a campaign and anonymised data is more than good enough for us to achieve our&nbsp;objectives.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll leave you with a parting note; as marketers, we&#8217;ve become entirely too comfortable handling vast swathes of personal data, it&#8217;s time we get used to a world where that options isn&#8217;t always going to be available to&nbsp;us. </p>
<hr>
<p>Usual caveats apply. I am not a&nbsp;lawyer.</p>
<p>&#8224; <em>Yes, I know a small minority are, but they&#8217;re a small minority. This might be one of the very few instances in which I&#8217;d recommend <span class="caps">SFMC</span></em></p>
