    <p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of projects fail over the years, here&#8217;s a non-exhaustive list of them and some reasons why they&nbsp;failed</p>
<h2>Love Community&nbsp;Site</h2>
<p>Love was an online procedurally generated video game released by Eskil Steenberg in <a href="http://www.quelsolaar.com/love/">2010</a>.</p>
<p>One of the modules in the second year of my Digital Arts degree was around creating online community platforms (I forget the precise name of the module), which I took entirely too literally and thus built a forum and wiki website for this game. The site was a simple vBulletin forum with a MediaWiki wiki, running on a crappy shared hosting&nbsp;provider.</p>
<p>While the community picked up quickly and I managed to do remarkably well on the <span class="caps">SEO</span> front for this site, ultimately the game was never a big success which led to the site slowly dying off. Thus would begin a recurring theme with online communities I&#8217;ve tried to&nbsp;build&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Minecraft came out around the same time, maybe I should have tried to do something with that</em>&nbsp;ðŸ¤”</p>
<h2>Path of Exile&nbsp;Wiki</h2>
<p>I first discovered Path of Exile through  Total Biscuit&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8779Ff_qoc"><span class="caps">WTF</span> is&#8230; - Path of Exile</a> video (this was before <span class="caps">TB</span> turned out to be a massive chud) and was instantly hooked as it reminded me so much of Diablo 2, which I&#8217;d played a ridiculous amount&nbsp;of.</p>
<p>The site <a href="https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Path_of_Exile_Wiki&amp;oldid=1">went live on September 25th 2011</a> and <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/9046">quickly picked up steam within the community</a> - I&#8217;d got the timing right and got in there before anyone else, which was pure&nbsp;luck.</p>
<p>The site soon became a victim of it&#8217;s own success and as it was hosted on my crappy shared hosting provider, kept going down as the game approached the big Open Beta launch phase in early 2013. I tried to move it but database extracts kept failing because of the size of the cache tables and my hosting provider didn&#8217;t seem to care to give me a&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_LLC">Curse</a> swooped in and offered to buy the site out from me - the offer seemed good at the time so I signed on the dotted lined and gave up control of my&nbsp;baby.</p>
<p>That decision opened up a lot of opportunities for me, but in hindsight turned out to have probably been a mistake. The site still does millions of pageviews a month and was firmly within the top 10 for traffic within Gamepedia (Curse&#8217;s wiki farm) when I last had access to&nbsp;stats.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t ever have predicted the scale of success that this reached but hindsight&#8217;s a bitch and I do regret selling&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><a href="https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Path_of_Exile_Wiki">Path of Exile Wiki</a> is still live if you want to check out what it looks like&nbsp;now.</p>
<h2>Hellgate&nbsp;Forums</h2>
<p>Hellgate: London  was a game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellgate:_London">released in 2007</a> that turned out to be a commercial&nbsp;failure.</p>
<p>It was, however, a ton of fun and as the studio responsible for the game was dissolved in 2008 the rights were snapped up and eventually the game was re-released in 2014 as Hellgate:&nbsp;Global.</p>
<p>I setup another Forum and Wiki combo but it was not to be - the game was heavily monetised and never picked up as well as the first iteration&nbsp;did.</p>
<p>I quickly folded the site and gave&nbsp;up.</p>
<h2><span class="caps">BFGA</span>&nbsp;Wiki</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a <strong><span class="caps">BIG</span></strong> Warhammer nerd, so when I found out that a game was being made licensing Games Workshop&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlefleet_Gothic">Battlefleet Gothic</a> <span class="caps">IP</span> I lept at the chance to quickly build a wiki for&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>This was actually part of a wider project - while at Curse I&#8217;d spoken to my boss about the lack of clear community platforms for the <span class="caps">GW</span> videogaming community and while he wasn&#8217;t enthused about the idea that didn&#8217;t deter me from running with it when I left Curse. That wider project involved a large forum and news combo site built on Invision Power Board and a network of related MediaWiki sites. I couldn&#8217;t get sufficient traffic to those properties so quickly killed them off, but <span class="caps">BFGA</span> Wiki was working, for a&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with MediaWiki, there&#8217;s a fantastic extension called <a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki">Semantic: Mediawiki</a> which allows you to store and query data directly within your wiki pages and templates. We&#8217;d used this on the PoE Wiki and it was hugely important there so I made use of it again to be able to quickly build queryable pages to minimise duplicate work. For example, with <span class="caps">SMW</span> you can <a href="https://www.semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Inline_queries">create a table of specific results</a> that match a query and output specific data values into that table. In the context of a videogame site you can quickly see how this can be used to generate lists of skills, ships, etc that are then easy to keep up to&nbsp;date.</p>
<p>Ultimately this never really picked up and I burnt out on it and let the domain&nbsp;expire.</p>
<p>You can see a snapshot of this wiki on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170426103307/http://www.bfgawiki.com/wiki/Battle_Cruiser">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
<h2>Appel du&nbsp;Vide</h2>
<p>For some reason, I thought I could build a business selling made to measure shearling&nbsp;jackets.</p>
<p>I had a sample bomber jacket made on Brick Lane by the folks at <a href="https://www.upperclassfashion.co.uk/">Upperclass Fashions</a> and shopped around for trims at London Trimmings in Whitechapel (they have awesome <a href="http://www.londontrimmings.co.uk/category.php?cat_id=32">Riri and <span class="caps">YKK</span> Excella zips</a>), I also spent a lot of time looking around for shearling suppliers in the <span class="caps">UK</span> and finding <span class="caps">UK</span> based companies that could make small batch&nbsp;jackets.</p>
<p>I then built an ecommerce site on Shopify and ran some ad campaigns on Facebook and Instagram. I ended up with a few people reaching out to me who were interested and met a couple of them to show them the sample jacket and to learn more about what they were after and how I could make it for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a real budget for this though and I felt way out of my depth trying to get samples made, patterns cut, etc so I ended up killing this project off before it ever had the chance to go anywhere. That sample jacket is still sitting in my&nbsp;wardrobe.</p>
<p>But hey, the domain name is still cool, I&#8217;ve got some future ideas for&nbsp;it&#8230;</p>
<h2>Old World&nbsp;Wiki</h2>
<p>Remember how I said I was a <span class="caps">BIG</span> Warhammer&nbsp;nerd? </p>
<p>This was another Warhammer community site, this time for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_War:_Warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a>, a game released by Creative Assembly in&nbsp;2016.</p>
<p>Helpfully, the game has great mod support and as a result you can easily export the game files in usable formats. This  meant I could build a custom Drupal site that would automatically create pages based on imported <span class="caps">CSV</span> data, and through abundant usage of the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/core/modules/views/overview">Views module</a> I could link these files together and populate site pages, and example of which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180124015058/http://oldworldwiki.com:80/grave-guard-0">you can see here</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d never really been properly exposed to <span class="caps">SQL</span> or database joins so this project really tested me and I learn a&nbsp;ton.</p>
<p>The site was never a big success though, so I let it die off&nbsp;slowly.</p>
<h2>Rend&nbsp;Forums</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a theme&nbsp;here&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rendgame.com/">Rend</a> is an online survival game by Frostkeep&nbsp;Studios.</p>
<p>When I saw the trailer for this game I knew I had to get involved in it. I&#8217;d seen how successful similar genre games were like <span class="caps">ARK</span>: Survival Evolved and Rust and thought this could be an opportunity to build a community&nbsp;site.</p>
<p>I got stuck in and quickly setup a forum and wiki using <span class="caps">IPB</span> and MediaWiki but quickly hit a&nbsp;roadblock.</p>
<p>Curse had announced that they were the &#8220;official&#8221; wiki partner to Rend, and Frostkeep built an in-house&nbsp;forum.</p>
<p>Under those conditions I knew there was little I could do to get the site going and quickly gave up on&nbsp;it.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Next&nbsp;&#8230;?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got to the bottom of this, you can probably see that there&#8217;s an ongoing theme&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>I like building online gaming communities, but all but one of them have ultimately been a&nbsp;failure.</p>
<p>I think there are a few reasons for this - but the biggest one was my lack of recognition that the internet itself has changed. People no longer look to join independent forums, indeed, what&#8217;s the point when you can just easily join a specific subreddit or Facebook&nbsp;group?</p>
<p>Similarly, Curse and Wikia (now Fandom) were in a huge growth phase and very quickly came to dominate the online gaming wiki world - with absolutely unbeatable <span class="caps">SEO</span> from their huge scale and a budget allowing them to attend conventions and make deals to host official communities with game developers and&nbsp;publishers.</p>
<p>Curse were recently bought by Fandom so this is now much worse, I&#8217;d estimate that at least 90% of English speaking videogame community wikis are owned by a single&nbsp;company.</p>
<p>Is there any future for online community builders? Yeah, maybe, but there are also huge barriers to entry that will be all but insurmountable for all but the most&nbsp;dedicated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learnt a lot which has helped me in my professional career and have had access to opportunities that I never could have thought of had I not built these&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>Ultimately I enjoy having side projects and don&#8217;t consider any of the above to have been wasted time, despite them not getting&nbsp;anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m now working on <a href="https://www.inkfolio.co/">something I find really exciting</a>, hopefully you will&nbsp;too.</strong></p>
