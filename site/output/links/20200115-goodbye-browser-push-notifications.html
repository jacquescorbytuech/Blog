  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>In 2015, browser push notifications were an exciting new way for websites to notify their visitors when something happened. Unfortunately, the inevitable happened, bad <em>and downright obnoxious</em> UX took over - you couldn't visit a website without being inundated with obnoxious opt-in messages, more often than not before you'd even had a chance to read the page you'd visited.</p>
<p>Firefox recently announced changes to the way they handle these notifications, directly as a result of the misuse by webmasters everwhere.</p>
<p>It's a shame, really. When my team implemented browser push to replace an email we were sending we saw much higher click rates and engagement with the product we were trying to promote.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we've done this to ourselves, I hope Chrome will follow suit soon.</p>
