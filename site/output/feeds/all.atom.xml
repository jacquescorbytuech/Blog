&lt;p&gt;Last June, to the surprise of many, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adam_rose/status/1140151337834962944"&gt;a Tweet&lt;/a&gt; was widely shared online, showing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt; admitting that their own cookie policy &amp;#8220;doesn&amp;#8217;t meet the required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;standard&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early July, this was followed up with &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/"&gt;new guidance on cookie usage&lt;/a&gt; that clearly exposes the way the industry has been mistreating customer data, and the ways we need to&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital Marketing&amp;nbsp;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at some ways digital marketers collect&amp;nbsp;data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Form&amp;nbsp;Submission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, data collected when a user submits a form is often used in marketing, for example an email address collected via a form will typically be sent marketing emails, or shared with Facebook to receive targeted advertising. It is not always explicitly explained at the point of form submission what data will be used for what and where the collected data may end up being sent&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cookies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Sites will typically use a cookie-based analytics tool, such as Google Analytics to identify how individuals use a website. This allows them to see precisely what pages an individual has visited, what elements of the website they&amp;#8217;ve interacted with, what devices they&amp;#8217;re using to access the site, where they&amp;#8217;re physically located (via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;), etc. Typically, this information is collected by third party services such as Google or&amp;nbsp;Adobe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalisation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  These cookies are used to collect precise behavioural information about a unique individual. For example, knowing what someone has added to their shopping basket on an ecommerce site, or keeping track of what pages someone has looked at to build up a personalised behavioural profile to later target them with more direct product messaging. These cookies can be first or third party, meaning that information is often sent off to opaque third party services that provide some form of personalisation engine to the&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retargeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Cookies like Facebook or Google Doubleclick (amongst others) collect information on an individual&amp;#8217;s website visit for the purpose of later identifying that individual across multiple separate websites which allows the cookie owner to build up a large data profile on the individual. Examples of the type of information collected are&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Age&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behaviour on your&amp;nbsp;website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behaviour on search&amp;nbsp;engines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behaviour on social&amp;nbsp;media&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  This data collection happens in the background of most websites and tends to be incredibly opaque as to how and what data is collected specifically and where it is sent&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Due to the way advertising works online, a publisher (a site or app running adverts) typically uses an auction system to determine which adverts to display to an individual user. This auction system involves sending data back and forth from the website to numerous online advertising exchanges to determine which specific advert should be shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should therefore come as no surprise that this process allows advertisers to create highly specific profiles of individuals and their behaviour online as they collect data through this auction&amp;nbsp;mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Telemetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use applications on your desktop,mobile or on the web, information about your specific interactions with the product may be recorded and sent directly to the product developer, for example to understand what specifically you have interacted with. &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2014/03/20/instrumenting-your-app-for-telemetry-and-analytics/"&gt;Microsoft calls this data a &amp;#8220;gold mine&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&amp;nbsp;Tracking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you receive a marketing email from a company, the email will contain tracking pixels telling the sender when (and often where and with what device) you open the email. They also contain tracking links allowing them to know specifically what an individual has clicked on in a received email. Furthermore the email may also contain additional third party tracking which function like the retargeting and advertising cookies mentioned&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data&amp;nbsp;brokerage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Experian and Equifax allow others to purchase personal information about you so that they can then target you for marketing. This frequently occurs without your knowledge or&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list and brands and marketers continue to innovate in the ways in which they can acquire your data without your express knowledge or&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken in combination, you can see how a business can quickly start to build an incredibly detailed view of an individual, how they can start to access that data directly as a first party or even start to target individuals through data held by third parties, such as when running advertising&amp;nbsp;campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly, marketers like to tell themselves that this is all above board – data is collected usually but not always for specific purposes and this data provides value to the business and hopefully (we like to tell ourselves) to the individual. The problem is in the opaqueness of the processes involved and the lack of consent or even knowledge by the end-user about the scope of the data collection taking&amp;nbsp;place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what are we doing with all this&amp;nbsp;data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Programmatic&amp;nbsp;Advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising based on individual user profiles and website placement. Look at any news website or your Instagram feed and you&amp;#8217;ll see this in&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retargeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to programmatic but based explicitly on targeting people who&amp;#8217;ve performed a specific action that has been tracked, such as looking at a particular&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targeted&amp;nbsp;Advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending email addresses or phone numbers to Google or Facebook so that individuals can be specifically targeted or lookalike audiences can be built based on a specific subset of customers provided by email address or phone&amp;nbsp;number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&amp;nbsp;Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending emails to individuals to get them to perform a specific action, such as signing up to your product or purchasing your latest&amp;nbsp;widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to email, but via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;. For example informing your customers of a sale or for shorter and more actionable&amp;nbsp;messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Push&amp;nbsp;notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like email but frequently based on more specific actions having occurred in an app, for example someone responding to a message you posted on social media or an action taking place in a mobile&amp;nbsp;game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at data collected from telemetry and various cookies to optimise our products and our sales&amp;nbsp;funnels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nothing at&amp;nbsp;all&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes businesses collect  data and just let it sit in a database without doing anything with it, go figure&amp;nbsp;🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list and is merely used to demonstrate some common scenarios in which data is used for&amp;nbsp;marketing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;d all like to think all this data is being handled carefully and responsibly, but ask any marketer and they&amp;#8217;ll have stories to tell about customer data being shared across the company through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; files or the business &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRM&lt;/span&gt;, without any oversight or mechanism to protect an individual&amp;#8217;s private&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So where does that leave&amp;nbsp;us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this new guidance, some things have become abundantly&amp;nbsp;clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot rely on implied consent to use&amp;nbsp;cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics cookies require&amp;nbsp;consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legitimate Interests cannot be used as a reason for processing analytics or advertising&amp;nbsp;cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; deal. Websites currently assume you consent to cookies until you tell them otherwise and will gleefully suck up as much data as they can collect until you stop them. This new guidance makes it explicitly clear that this is no longer allowed and that a business &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; obtain consent before they engage in these&amp;nbsp;activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead. Switch to a log-based analytics system and strip out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;. You might be able to obtain consent for your analytics cookies but hey, who am I kidding, we&amp;#8217;ve trained people to hit the big ❌ button on popups so they&amp;#8217;ll close your popup immediately without giving you&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Programmatic&amp;nbsp;advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll still be able to target people based on the website you wish to place an advert on, but advertising brokers will no longer have monolithic profiles of profiles you can target based on interests, demographics, etc. This is a big loss for businesses and a &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HUGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; win for individual&amp;nbsp;privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retargeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead. Deader than dead. Good luck obtaining consent when you have to explain to your users that you want to stalk them around the web for products they spent all of 3 seconds looking at on your site. Good fucking&amp;nbsp;riddance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targeted&amp;nbsp;Advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead. No one will want to give you consent to send off their personal data to third parties. Advertisers will also struggle to obtain interest and demographic data making lookalike audiences much less&amp;nbsp;valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/gdpr-email-tracking.html"&gt;Legitimate interest isn&amp;#8217;t good enough&lt;/a&gt;, you need to obtain consent for marketing emails&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and unless you have explicitly collected consent for tracking you cannot track how individuals behave within your&amp;nbsp;emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like email, you&amp;#8217;re going to need to collect consent to use SMs for marketing. There&amp;#8217;s some real opportunties to demonstrate the value of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; to customers here, you&amp;#8217;ll just have to think&amp;nbsp;creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Push&amp;nbsp;Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need consent, but you already needed that. Push notifications are probably going to suffer the least because there have been solid mechanisms in place for years to prevent misuse from&amp;nbsp;marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to be paying Facebook or YouTube given what they&amp;#8217;re up&amp;nbsp;to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big winners are going to be the channels which can most clearly communicate an obvious value exchange between the individual customer and the business. Unsurprisingly, given what I do, I think these are channels like email, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and push notifications. Once you&amp;#8217;ve built an existing relationship with an individual, they are more likely to see the benefit in giving you permission to  message them via these&amp;nbsp;channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising(⚰️) in all forms is the clear loser - this new cookie guidance effectively put the nail in the coffin of digital advertising as we know it. You&amp;#8217;ll no longer be able to target individuals based on what pages of your website they&amp;#8217;ve visited or their interests, geographical location or demographic data. &lt;a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/company/advertising-and-affiliates/"&gt;DuckDuckGo already demonstrates&lt;/a&gt; how we can move towards a more compliant and a more ethical take on advertising. Budgets will inevitable suffer as performance decreases across digital advertising&amp;nbsp;channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer acquisition optimisation is going to suffer. Without clear analytics across the board we&amp;#8217;ll have to do a lot more work done to understand how individual campaigns have performed. There are plenty of ways we can do this, for example having personalised landing pages per campaign and measuring the aggregate number of visits to that page (ie without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt; to identify unique visits) vs the number of purchases or form submissions. I think we&amp;#8217;ll see more investment in this area as gauging the effectiveness of our marketing spend becomes increasingly&amp;nbsp;challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers are going to have to adapt to these changes and we&amp;#8217;re going to have to take a very close look at how permission is currently obtained in mobile apps. It&amp;#8217;s clear that they&amp;#8217;re leading the way in this area and understand that progressively obtaining permission (consent, in our case) based on specific interactions (for example, asking for camera permissions when the app user wishes to take a photo in the app) is the way we&amp;#8217;re going to have to&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this purpose it behoves all of us in marketing to propose a new framework for ethical marketing and more purposeful and transparent data collection. It is a position of extreme arrogance on the behalf of marketers and businesses to believe that our bottom line is more important than an individual&amp;#8217;s privacy. What the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; has achieved with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; is making it clear that this is absolutely not the&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an age in which marketing data is used to enable electoral fraud and strip our civil liberties, we need to do&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;there are of course other types of email and reasons other than marketing to send emails which I won&amp;#8217;t cover&amp;nbsp;here&lt;/li&gt;

Deeply insightful and provided some real perspective on the Communist Party of China and how confucianism still leads and influences modern policy in the country. Kissinger is entirely too easy on Mao and the millions of deaths he caused as a result of his policies and the political upheaval that he lead - but I certainly learnt a lot about the history of the country and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; some of the diplomatic policies were the way that they were. A hugely fascinating read if you want to understand what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world right now and how we got&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading Catherine Nixey&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35450727-the-darkening-age"&gt;The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, it&amp;#8217;s, errrr, not off to a good start, but I&amp;#8217;ll hold off on my judgement until I&amp;#8217;ve read the whole&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the climate continues to be a pressing issue - immigration and mass migrations as a result of armed conflict have been serious issues for hundreds of years, but soon we&amp;#8217;ll start seeing these mass migrations occur as a result of climate change, with recent examples in &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7823/the-slow-erosion-of-northern-pakistan-batura-glacier-gilgit-baltistan-passu"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/08/alexandria-climate-change-sea-level-canals-al-max-fishing/596593/"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; showing how glacial thawing and rising sea levels will impact people&amp;#8217;s lives and&amp;nbsp;livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2015/02/rising-sea-levels-are-already-making-miamis-floods-worse/385619/"&gt;some of the damage&lt;/a&gt; this can cause, we need to do something about it &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoculture farming continues to be an environmental distaster, the most recent victim being the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/banana-disease-tr4-latin-america"&gt;humble banana&lt;/a&gt;, which is now threatened by a fungus that could kill the plant off&amp;nbsp;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now seems like a good time to familiarise yourself with Yvon Chouinard and how &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/patagonias-philosopher-king"&gt;his environmental beliefs&lt;/a&gt; have shaped the apparel company Patagonia. Business &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help us save the environment - but only if we consume less and are more thoughtful about our purchasing&amp;nbsp;habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve heard people talking about Morning Brew for a while now but &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-morning-brews-referral-program-built-an-audience-of-1-5-million-subscribers-3315482c1aa5"&gt;this article about their referral program&lt;/a&gt; is deeply insightful, without the toxic &amp;#8220;growthhacker&amp;#8221; mentality than you often see on topics like this. Covering everything from how they technically went about setting up the program to their reasoning behind their gift tiers, including breakdowns for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;, there&amp;#8217;s a lot to learn from&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;#8217;re here, you should &lt;a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=e4310460"&gt;sign up to their daily email&lt;/a&gt; as well (That&amp;#8217;s a referral link 😉, I want the&amp;nbsp;mug!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of Wikipedia, and some of the &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7749/creepy-wikipedia-explainer"&gt;absurd policies and fringe interests&lt;/a&gt; that run on the&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Wikipedia, did you know that it&amp;#8217;s built on an open source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; platform called Mediawiki? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/1163453179499089921"&gt;Jacobian on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking about the good old days, when you could get software running on a server without needing to understand command lines, containers, front end frameworks and all that other gubbins. It&amp;#8217;s still a language that&amp;#8217;s used all across the web, including &lt;a href="https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe it&amp;#8217;s time we started taking it seriously&amp;nbsp;again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to save capitalism? Maybe we should all just be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/opinion/business-roundtable.html"&gt;getting paid more&lt;/a&gt; so we can consume more, or, you know, consume more&amp;nbsp;ethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videogame industry has a &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7803/are-video-games-political-conservative-liberal"&gt;politics problem&lt;/a&gt;, and an audience that&amp;#8217;s too uneducated to understand that supporting the status quo is, in and of itself a political stance. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/18/the-mainstream-media-have-still-not-learned-the-lessons-of-gamergate/"&gt;Gamergate exposed an ugly underbelly&lt;/a&gt; to male hobby led online communities, and it appears some people have been taking note. Disney appear to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keefstuart/status/1164101226889383936"&gt;weaponising their audience&lt;/a&gt; in their recent failed negotiation attempts with Sony with regards to the Spider Man&amp;nbsp;franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of corporate cowardice in the face of an increasingly politically aware society, &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/we-will-continue-to-represent-men-at-their-best-gillettes-backflip-after-toxic-masculinity-backlash/news-story/8ae70a5abc31280fc23711dcf7c30e5e"&gt;Gilette just backtracked their &amp;#8220;toxic masculinity&amp;#8221; campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Netflix&amp;#8217;s The Great Hack a few weeks ago, while there were certainly no deep revelations if you&amp;#8217;ve been paying attention over the last couple years, it is beginning to &lt;a href="https://www.mumbrella.asia/2019/08/why-netflixs-the-great-hack-should-make-all-of-us-in-marketing-uncomfortable"&gt;expose the darker side of digital marketing&lt;/a&gt;. Big tech platforms are responsible for a lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html"&gt;problems we&amp;#8217;re seeing in society today&lt;/a&gt;, so it should come as no surprise that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/facebook-releases-new-cambridge-analytica-documents.html"&gt;Zuckerberg lied&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook&amp;#8217;s knowledge of what was going on with Cambridge Analytica&amp;#8217;s data&amp;nbsp;exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the communication, one of the employees called the Cambridge Analytica situation “hi pri” for high priority after The Guardian ran its article claiming the presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was using data on Facebook users largely without their&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping this stuff in mind, it&amp;#8217;s hard not to support Apple&amp;#8217;s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/sign-in-with-apple-goodbye-account-management/"&gt;obfuscate individual&amp;#8217;s email addresses&lt;/a&gt; when they sign up to services using Sign in with Apple. We&amp;#8217;ve proven time and time again that we can&amp;#8217;t be trusted with personal data and I think we can only expect services like this to become increasingly prevalent as these scandals continue to&amp;nbsp;unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is advancing and opportunities are being created everywhere, it&amp;#8217;s hard not to look at something like &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/artificial-intelligence-marketing-and-phrasee/"&gt;Phrasee&lt;/a&gt; with optimism, we&amp;#8217;ll see some radical shifts in marketing when we can focus on the top-level strategy and leave the more tactical elements - like good writing - to tools better suited to the&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to only read viewpoints that come from a particular societal point of view, but we can only really learn and improve when we consider how other&amp;#8217;s see the world, something that &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1144408/bruce-lee-maximized-his-success-by-taking-the-best-of-both-eastern-and-western-philosophies"&gt;Bruce Lee&lt;/a&gt; understood better than&amp;nbsp;most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benek Lisefski writes that &lt;a href="https://modus.medium.com/data-driven-design-is-killing-our-instincts-d448d141653d"&gt;&amp;#8220;Data-Driven Design Is Killing Our Instincts&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and Tanner Christensen writes that &lt;a href="https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2019/7/22/when-every-product-of-design-is-one-of-opinion"&gt;&amp;#8220;every product of design is one of opinion&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, it seems to me like there&amp;#8217;s a middle ground to be reached where opinionated experience and data informs the creative&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, &lt;a href="https://leerob.io/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/"&gt;Lee Robinson&lt;/a&gt; has an excellent breakdown of Style Guides and Design Systems. This one&amp;#8217;s well worth&amp;nbsp;bookmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alistapart.com/article/the-career-management-document/"&gt;An article on A List Apart&lt;/a&gt; recently got me thinking about how I keep track of my career accomplishments and progress, I&amp;#8217;m going to start taking weekly notes to keep track of the big&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/21/practice-does-not-always-make-perfect-violinists-10000-hour-rule"&gt;A recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the Guardians opens up with this great&amp;nbsp;sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With blatant disregard for the public benefits of motivational idioms, researchers have concluded that practice does not, necessarily, make&amp;nbsp;perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in these ideas, but sometimes practice for practice&amp;#8217;s sake is worth pursuing, even if you won&amp;#8217;t turn out to be an&amp;nbsp;expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/08/thomas-guide-los-angeles-history-street-map-google-waze-app/591721/"&gt;this article on maps&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating. It has been proven that &lt;a href="https://qz.com/977356/being-bilingual-makes-you-experience-time-differently/"&gt;the way we consume information shapes our perception of the world&lt;/a&gt;, maybe we&amp;#8217;ve lost a part of ourselves by relying on technology so&amp;nbsp;much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big shoutout to the folks at &lt;a href="http://actionrocket.co/"&gt;Action Rocket&lt;/a&gt; for the meetup this week. It was excellent as&amp;nbsp;always.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weekly Reading</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190812-weekly-reading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-18T15:48:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-18T15:48:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-08-18:/writing/20190812-weekly-reading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally finished The Inheritance of&amp;nbsp;Rome!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#8217;s been a good week, I was in Provence enjoying some much needed sunshine and rosé and catching up on some&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; finished &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7203544-the-inheritance-of-rome"&gt;The Inheritance of Rome&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;#8217;ve been reading since early July. I&amp;#8217;m not normally this slow at getting through a book, but this was one hell of an information-dense read. It&amp;#8217;s fascinating to see how the foundations of our modern world were set through this early Middle Ages period. It&amp;#8217;s a shame Ibn Hawqal&amp;#8217;s book on Sicilian idiocy has been lost to time, if only for the sheer pettiness of the&amp;nbsp;author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also finished was &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2595.Marketing_Warfare"&gt;Marketing Warfare&lt;/a&gt; by Al Ries which while interesting, I can&amp;#8217;t help but feel like the military anecdotes are a little trite. There&amp;#8217;s definitely a lot to unpack in there, and I found it helpful to have more strategic principles detailed in such a clear way. While the author ascribes these as marketing challenges (and maybe they were when this was published in &amp;#8216;85) it seems like business has changed and the challenges outlined are more to do with company strategy as opposed to pure marketing&amp;nbsp;strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves me with Henry Kissinger&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14799927-on-china"&gt;On China&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;#8217;m ~80% through - more on that next&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news I had plenty of time to catch up on some more general reading, more on which&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it seems like some positive news regarding Facebook, in as much as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/749474600/users-can-sue-facebook-over-facial-recognition-software-court-rules?t=1566139785117"&gt;a court has decided that users can sue over their use of facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, that&amp;#8217;s not the only issue they&amp;#8217;re facing this week with new information coming to light about &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio"&gt;potentially sensitive user audio being listened to by human contractors&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook employing some &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/technology/facebook-antitrust.html"&gt;defensive warfare&lt;/a&gt; (See, I learnt something from that book) following a resurgence in calls for the company to be broken up by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like Facebook aren&amp;#8217;t the only ones in hot water over creepy facial recognition tech, unknown to pretty much everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42d087fa-bf79-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722"&gt;King&amp;#8217;s Cross station was using the technology too&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/major-breach-found-in-biometrics-system-used-by-banks-uk-police-and-defence-firms"&gt;major breach&lt;/a&gt; has been found in Biostar 2&amp;#8217;s systems, with more than a million people compromised.&amp;nbsp;🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hadn&amp;#8217;t already noticed, the world&amp;#8217;s falling apart. Mass tourism is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-12/tourism-is-overwhelming-the-world-s-top-destinations"&gt;creating issues&lt;/a&gt; (to put it lightly) in popular holiday spots and &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/08/potable-water-safe-to-drink-cities-global-south-drought-data/595966/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/opinion/why-new-york-city-needs-universal-internet-access.html"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; access in cities continues to be inadequate and only getting worse as demand continues to increase without adequate infrastructural investment. Germany appears to be entertaining some interesting ideas on a potential &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/11/20798683/meat-sin-tax-climate-change-animal-welfare-germany"&gt;&amp;#8220;sin tax&amp;#8221; on eating meat&lt;/a&gt;, it certainly seems like something worth considering given the ecological impact of animal&amp;nbsp;husbandry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the climate weren&amp;#8217;t a big deal, Nike seems to think there&amp;#8217;s a need for a &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/12/business/nike-sneaker-subscription/index.html"&gt;subscription service&lt;/a&gt; giving kids 4 to 12 pairs of shoes a year. Given the crucial importance of &lt;a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1670729/the-importance-of-clothing-resale-to-sustainable-fashion-in-2019/"&gt;decreasing the environmental impact of our fashion purchases&lt;/a&gt;, this seems like a particularly meaningful kick in the teeth from a company that pretends towards left-leaning&amp;nbsp;ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if all that wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/17/plastic-recycling-myth-what-really-happens-your-rubbish"&gt;recycling might not be as green as we all like to tell ourselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733319301234#!"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; has been published exporing some of the issues in ensuring low-skilled workers benefit from increasing investment in high-tech jobs in Britain. Citylab has an &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/08/technology-employment-multiplier-effect-inequality-research/595291/"&gt;excellent breakdown&lt;/a&gt; on this issue. Unsurprisingly, it&amp;#8217;s not all sunshine and&amp;nbsp;rainbows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we (as in the British) are &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/13/the-world-is-reaping-the-chaos-the-british-empire-sowed/"&gt;to blame&lt;/a&gt; for everything that&amp;#8217;s going&amp;nbsp;wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic has a great article on the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/arrogance-anthropocene/595795/"&gt;Anthropocene and human arrogance&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s well worth a&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The idea of the Anthropocene inflates our own importance by promising eternal geological life to our creations. It is of a thread with our species’ peculiar, self-styled exceptionalism—from the animal kingdom, from nature, from the systems that govern it, and from time itself. This illusion may, in the long run, get us all&amp;nbsp;killed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know much about modern Russia, I&amp;#8217;m going to have to find some good books to read in the near future to understand why &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/10/thousands-march-in-moscow-disqualification-city-elections"&gt;events like this&lt;/a&gt; are&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you have more than a passing interest in tattoos, Artsy have a great article on &lt;a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-japanese-prints-inspired-tattoo-frenzy"&gt;Utagawa Kuniyoshi&amp;#8217;s influence&lt;/a&gt; on Japanese&amp;nbsp;tattooing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional thinking tells us that a good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UX&lt;/span&gt; is one in which the number of clicks the user makes is minimised. But sometimes, &lt;a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-should-forget-about-the-number-of-clicks-b80532475fae"&gt;that just ain&amp;#8217;t right&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the problem is we&amp;#8217;re all used to &lt;a href="https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/"&gt;generic, formulaic thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quartz published an excellent article on some of the &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1657890/this-is-how-shopping-sites-trick-you-for-money-and-info/"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; we employ on ecommerce and similar sites. I get it, we use dark patterns because they work, but at some point we need to think about the moral and societal repercussions of our&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In brighter news&lt;/strong&gt;, two new experimental &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/health/ebola-outbreak-cure.html"&gt;treatments for Ebola&lt;/a&gt; are working well enough that they will now be offered to all patients in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Bailey&amp;#8217;s Artnome project has been on my radar for a couple years, this recent article showcases the &lt;a href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/7/24/generative-portraiture-of-espen-kluge"&gt;artwork of Espen Kluge&lt;/a&gt;, a Norwegian artist who uses generative algorithms to create abstract portraits. His work&amp;#8217;s both visually gorgeous and technically&amp;nbsp;fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you weren&amp;#8217;t asking but no, you still shouldn&amp;#8217;t trust big tech companies with your personal data. I hope regulatory bodies across Europe take leaf out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s book and start to impose some hefty fines on companies that keep doing this to&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/08/how-stop-gull-stealing-your-food"&gt;How to stop a gull from stealing your&amp;nbsp;food&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#8217;s been to Brighton knows that seagulls are arseholes who&amp;#8217;ll swoop in and steal your bag of chips or doughnuts without a care in the world. Next time you find yourself face to beak with one of these rats of the coast, remember this sage&amp;nbsp;advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The study suggests gulls find the human gaze terrifying—and that they take human behavior into account when trawling the city for meals. The researchers say changes in human behavior may save us a chip or two—and help guide more effective gull conservation efforts. So, next time a pesky gull tries to steal your food, don’t run away; try having a staring contest with it&amp;nbsp;instead.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/epic-store-rage-has-gotten-out-of-hand-1837008625"&gt;Epic Store Rage Has Gotten Out Of&amp;nbsp;Hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamers. Sigh. The latest scandal in gaming is apparently developers daring to sell the game they&amp;#8217;ve made through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPIC&lt;/span&gt; game store instead of whatever other digital storefront. This is apparently &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; an affront that exceedingly special members of the gaming community have decided it&amp;#8217;s worth sending death and rape threats to developers. If you want to understand the rise of the alt-right and some of the tactics they use, looking at events like this and Gamergate will help make things&amp;nbsp;clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.revolvermag.com/music/slipknot-darkness-anger-addiction-behind-iowa-we-almost-all-died"&gt;Slipknot on Darkness, Anger, Addiction Behind ‘Iowa’: “We Almost All&amp;nbsp;Died”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer it was released, I spent weeks listening to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOWA&lt;/span&gt; by Slipknot on repeat while playing the Warhammer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUD&lt;/span&gt;, Wolfenburg. Anytime I hear it now, I get flashbacks to sitting at home staring at screens full of descriptive text, slowly typing my way to victory. This article was shared on the EmailGeeks slack by Waz and I immediately had to start listening to the album again, and yep, the flashbacks to that time were still in full&amp;nbsp;effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t a favourite of mine at the time by any means, but it&amp;#8217;s grown a lot on me and the stories the Slipknot crew tell about that time period are&amp;nbsp;fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAHAN&lt;/span&gt; Best time for me was when Sid was a little out of control, wouldn&amp;#8217;t get his shit down. He&amp;#8217;s like, &amp;#8220;I gotta go. My grandfather&amp;#8217;s dying. I gotta get there. Shit&amp;#8217;s going on.&amp;#8221; Grandpa dies. Didn&amp;#8217;t get there. Sid shows up. But we see he&amp;#8217;s hurting. He gets in [the recording booth]. They start the song. He starts singing. Next thing you know the song&amp;#8217;s done, he has a breakdown and that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;(515)&amp;#8221; [the intro of Iowa]. That&amp;#8217;s all Sid. Just gone. I come in the next day, Ross is weeping. Puts his arms around me. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for you, Clown. You&amp;#8217;re one of the few people that&amp;#8217;s gonna understand this. This is my favorite part of the record. It&amp;#8217;s the realest part of the record.&amp;#8221; It was Sid having a breakdown from all the pain in this thing called&amp;nbsp;Slipknot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you know, there are some deep flaws with Deepmind&amp;#8217;s health research. Unsurprisingly, feeding an algorithm gender biased data results in a gender biased model. Quelle surprise&amp;nbsp;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Google machine learning company trumpeted its success in predicting a deadly kidney condition, but its results raise questions around data rights and patient&amp;nbsp;diversity&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Profitwell always turn out excellent research, this is the latest example of that. If you&amp;#8217;re selling a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAAS&lt;/span&gt; product and want to learn something, read this.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;In July, the head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Erbas, declared that same-sex relationships constituted “heresy.” This is the same institution that in 2018 claimed on their website that girls as young as nine years old were spiritually ready to get married. One out of every three marriages in the country today involves underage girls, according to women’s rights groups. Cases of gender-based violence in Turkey escalated by 1,400% from 2002 to&amp;nbsp;2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I site Turkey because it gives us a salient example of how populist nationalism—and its next-in-line, populist authoritarianism—not only generates nativism and a systematic distrust of foreigners, but exacerbates sexism, misogyny and&amp;nbsp;homophobia.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate writing, I don&amp;#8217;t feel good at it and it feels like, at any moment, someone will realise I&amp;#8217;m as dumb as I sometimes feel I am. This article was a good kick in the arse for me to just get on with it and worry about it&amp;nbsp;later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Personal growth is perhaps the most important outcome of keeping a work diary, according to Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile and psychologist Steven Kramer, co-authors of the book The Progress Principle. As they explain in an article for the Harvard Business Review, they asked more than 200 knowledge workers to write in a diary for no more than 10 minutes a day while working on a complex project. While the participants said the exercise helped them stay focused and organized, they were especially struck by the psychological revelations that occurred to them as they&amp;nbsp;wrote.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t been paying attention, America&amp;#8217;s got a white supremacy problem. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s got the lowdown on how Trump&amp;#8217;s inflammatory language has been used across more than 2,000 ads on Facebook and why that&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite working in email for the last 8 years, I still struggle to read email headers. This article is probably the best thing I&amp;#8217;ve read on the subject, hugely informative if you want to help others understand just why email is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re active in online communities, particularly technical ones, it&amp;#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in the idea that everyone&amp;#8217;s doing the latest thing, this is as true in web design as it is in email&amp;nbsp;marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;They are the 99% of the web universe that is quietly getting on, not blogging about their technology stack, not publishing amazing new tooling. Simply building&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call them the 1% with purpose, in a deliberate evocation of the privileged 1% who run our planet (because I love to jump analogy mid post and to distort numbers). To be on a cutting edge team is a privilege. It means having resources and money and a lack of accountability that most web developers simply don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;have.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

I recall watching the race with my dad in our sitting room in France, he was home from the hospital after a heavy bout of chemo and the loss of one of his heroes bought him to tears. A few months later, in December, he died&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close to 25 years later, a few weeks ago, his father passed away. In many ways, he was the father I never really had the luxury of having, pushing me into various sports, teaching me to read a clock, to speak to strangers and so much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see the rise of hateful father figures in society like Jordan Peterson. Cheerily leading vulnerable young white men towards paths of intolerance and hatred for others in the name of a quick buck. When simple advice like “clean your room” gets passed alongside race baiting &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/02/the-unwelcome-revival-of-race-science"&gt;“Race &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IQ&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/a&gt; lies and society turns inwards and backwards, sparking intolerance and attacks towards women, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/span&gt;+ community and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are we to do with all the angry young white&amp;nbsp;men?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you reading this might have seen me talk about this problem in the very excellent &lt;a href="https://email.geeks.chat"&gt;Email Geeks Community&lt;/a&gt;, but if you&amp;#8217;re new, let me break it down for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; came into effect, which put in place some rigorous laws around data processing and how personally identifiable information (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;) has to be handled. This stressed out a lot of email marketers, who quite rightly realised that the new regulations would have a significant effect on their ability to acquire and market to customers via their email address (which counts as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you&amp;#8217;re reading this, you&amp;#8217;re probably familiar with how that&amp;#8217;s gone, so I won&amp;#8217;t bore you with the&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So What&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;Problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of commercial email sent today contains tracking pixels and tracking links, these are used to uniquely identify individuals so that opens and clicks can be correctly attributed to them. This isn&amp;#8217;t strictly a problem, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; does not ban processing of personal data for tracking purposes, however email tracking frequently fails to meet a number of criteria necessary to be legal under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#8217;re not collection consent to track user behaviour&lt;/strong&gt; - That means we&amp;#8217;re probably relying on good old Legitimate Interest and that&amp;#8217;s frought with a number of&amp;nbsp;risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, most brands aren&amp;#8217;t disclosing in their privacy policies or at moment of signup that they&amp;#8217;re tracking user behaviour in marketing emails. That&amp;#8217;s a problem. &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/"&gt;Article 5&lt;/a&gt; clearly states that to be legally compliant, personal data should be processed in the following&amp;nbsp;manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and&amp;nbsp;transparency’);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is further expanded upon in &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-39/"&gt;Recital 39&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be&amp;nbsp;processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to adequately disclose email tracking within your brand&amp;#8217;s privacy policy is a clear breach of the&amp;nbsp;regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, when Legitimate Interest is used as the legal basis for processing of personal data, the data subject has the &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/"&gt;Right to Object&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those&amp;nbsp;provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that when processing data under a Legitimate Interest basis, the data subject has the right to object to your tracking, this brings us round to our second&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Email Marketing Platforms Are Not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Compliant&amp;#8224;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;, does it allow you to, on a per individual basis, opt-out of email&amp;nbsp;tracking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to that is no, and in most cases the answer will be no, you&amp;#8217;re in breach of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; as soon as a customer objects to your data processing. That is assuming you disclose the tracking in your privacy policy, if you don&amp;#8217;t you&amp;#8217;re already in&amp;nbsp;breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more of a legal quagmire as soon as we start looking at tracking in emails sent on a legal basis other than Consent or Legitimate&amp;nbsp;Interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you do about&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complain to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt; Complain frequently and loudly. Make them do something about it. Ultimately the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; is here to stay, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s must put in the work to allow marketers to comply with the&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Does That Leave Email&amp;nbsp;Marketing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email marketing isn&amp;#8217;t going anywhere, email remains one of the most valuable channels for reaching your customers and losing the ability to track behavioural data isn&amp;#8217;t going to change that fundamental fact. What is going to change is our ability to act upon vast swathes of personal&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not a problem, personal data is not a crucial part of gauging the success of a campaign and anonymised data is more than good enough for us to achieve our&amp;nbsp;objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll leave you with a parting note; as marketers, we&amp;#8217;ve become entirely too comfortable handling vast swathes of personal data, it&amp;#8217;s time we get used to a world where that option isn&amp;#8217;t always going to be available to&amp;nbsp;us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual caveats apply. I am not a&amp;nbsp;lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8224; &lt;em&gt;Yes, I know a small minority are, but they&amp;#8217;re a small minority. This might be one of the very few instances in which I&amp;#8217;d recommend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tough Mudder</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/tough-mudder.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-06T20:27:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-06T20:27:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-05-06:/writing/tough-mudder.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, it was&amp;nbsp;tough.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the London West Tough Mudder event with a great group of colleagues from Paymentsense, and, well, it was fucking freezing&amp;nbsp;🥶.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, my dodgy hip flexor played up so I had to pull out around mile 6. Felt like a serious bummer but I didn&amp;#8217;t want to push it so far I&amp;#8217;d be struggling to walk for the next month. You can see how I did over on the &lt;a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/3617216339"&gt;Garmin activity page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;ll be back next year, just need to sort this hip&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hello World</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/hello-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-06T13:37:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-06T13:37:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-05-06:/writing/hello-world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is this a blog? I think it might just&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;#8217;s been a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; time since I&amp;#8217;ve bothered to have a blog or personal site of any sort - and while I&amp;#8217;ve certainly dabbled in a bunch of web related projects over the years (mostly wikis and video game community related stuff), I&amp;#8217;ve not really &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; the web properly in a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this represents a new start of sorts. I&amp;#8217;m currently dabbling in Python in an effort to learn some new skills, so this site is being generated through &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python based static site generator. I&amp;#8217;m also experimenting with Github, something that seems trivial to most developers but I never got around to learning for no good reason at all. Site content is being hosted in an Azure blob, which is easy peasy through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I&amp;#8217;d like become more rounded as a marketer by being able to actually get stuck in with some of the more technical projects that I like being involved in. I guess I&amp;#8217;ll be posting some of my efforts about that here, along with whatever else takes my&amp;nbsp;fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for dropping&amp;nbsp;in!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
