I think it might just&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;#8217;s been a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; time since I&amp;#8217;ve bothered to have a blog or personal site of any sort - and while I&amp;#8217;ve certainly dabbled in a bunch of web related projects over the years (mostly wikis and video game community related stuff), I&amp;#8217;ve not really &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; the web properly in a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this represents a new start of sorts. I&amp;#8217;m currently dabbling in Python in an effort to learn some new skills, so this site is being generated through &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python based static site generator. I&amp;#8217;m also experimenting with Github, something that seems trivial to most developers but I never got around to learning for no good reason at all. Site content is being hosted in an Azure blob, which is easy peasy through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I&amp;#8217;d like become more rounded as a marketer by being able to actually get stuck in with some of the more technical projects that I like being involved in. I guess I&amp;#8217;ll be posting some of my efforts about that here, along with whatever else takes my&amp;nbsp;fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for dropping&amp;nbsp;in!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
