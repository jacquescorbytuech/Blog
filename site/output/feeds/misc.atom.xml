There&amp;#8217;s frankly not a ton to say about it, it was fun and you should read&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#8217;m reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25768015-traction"&gt;Traction&lt;/a&gt; by Garbriel Weinberg - it&amp;#8217;s quite a fortuitous time as work has just started on the development of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MVP&lt;/span&gt; for a digital product I&amp;#8217;m running. This is as good a time as any to swat up on some basic marketing principles to hopefully hit the ground running when it&amp;#8217;s ready for prime time in a few&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;#8217;ve anecdotally  noticed personally, but it seems that phones could be &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/were-so-reliant-on-our-phones-theyve-warped-our-sense-of-space-and-time"&gt;warping our perception of time and space&lt;/a&gt;. This seems like it should be more of a philosophical question, if our perception of time is changing, what does that say about our&amp;nbsp;perception?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite fantasy authors, and a philosopher in his own right contributed an essay entitled &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/40569466/On_the_Death_of_Meaning"&gt;On the Death of Meaning&lt;/a&gt; to a recent book entitled &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45007110-new-directions-in-philosophy-and-literature"&gt;New Directions in Philosophy and Literature&lt;/a&gt;. Bakker&amp;#8217;s previous writing on what he calls &lt;a href="https://www.academia.edu/1502945/The_Last_Magic_Show_A_Blind_Brain_Theory_of_the_Appearance_of_Consciousness"&gt;The Blind Brain Hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; is a critical part of his fictional works and this latest essay is well worth spending a few hours&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t been sitting under a rock for the last few weeks you may have seen that Eliud Kipchoge became the first person ever to break the sub 2-hour marathon. It took a team of &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1727150/breaking-marathon-barrier-required-43-world-class-runners/"&gt;42 elite athletes&lt;/a&gt; to help him get&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kipchoge told Runner’s World in August that breaking the 2-hour mark was more important than his other accolades, including his Olympic medals. But when the day finally came and Kipchoge charged through the storied time barrier, he gave credit to the extraordinary athletes who ran in front, beside, and behind him for nearly all of the 26.2 miles. “The pacemakers did a great job, they are among the best runners of all time,” he said in a statement published by Ineos. “I thank them and appreciate them for accepting to do the&amp;nbsp;job.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the Chinese crackdown continues in Hong Kong, brands are starting to show the cracks. Among them, Nike, who &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/16/nikes-dream-crazy-advert-starring-colin-kaepernick-wins-emmy"&gt;just last year&lt;/a&gt; ran a campaign with the slogan of &amp;#8220;Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing&amp;nbsp;everything&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;#8217;t it ironic then to see Nike (and others) cave in to Chinese pressure and remove merchandise in key Chinese stores following remarks made by the Houston Rockets General Manager. Ever a source of sanity in the world of advertising bullshit, Bob Hoffman hit the nail on the head in his &lt;a href="http://createsend.com/t/d-189F72B95AD06BCB2540EF23F30FEDED"&gt;recent newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bethany McLean&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19228776-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room"&gt;The Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron&lt;/a&gt; is the tell-all story behind the rise and crushing downfall of Enron, which at it&amp;#8217;s peak in 2000 was one of the most valuable companies in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the story unveils you start to grasp the cavalier attitudes that led to Enron&amp;#8217;s inevitable downfall, including Enron&amp;#8217;s involvement in the 2000 California electricity crisis, where Enron purposefully manipulated the market with such schemes as &amp;#8220;Fat Boy&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Death Star&amp;#8221; to make hundreds of millions of dollars in trading profits - to the detriment of&amp;nbsp;Californians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this isn&amp;#8217;t just a story about an energy crisis, this is a story about the rampant unethical and illegal activity that led to the company inevitably declaring bankruptcy after their accounting schemes ran away from&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you have a dog, but you need to create a duck on the financial statements. Fortunately, there are specific accounting rules for what constitutes a duck: yellow feet, white covering, orange beak. So you take the dog and paint its feet yellow and its fur white and you paste an orange plastic beak on its nose, and then you say to your accountants, ‘This is a duck! Don’t you agree that it’s a duck?’ And the accountants say, ‘Yes, according to the rules, this is a duck.’ Everybody knows that it’s a dog, not a duck, but that doesn’t matter, because you’ve met the rules for calling it a&amp;nbsp;duck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you ever want to understand quite how badly capitalism can go wrong without adequate oversight, &lt;strong&gt;read this book&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the fun side effects of the Enron bankruptcy and subsequent fraud investigations by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SEC&lt;/span&gt; is that it gave us the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Corpus"&gt;Enron Corpus&lt;/a&gt;, a database of over 600,000 emails sent by some of Enron&amp;#8217;s key employees. This dataset has been key in developing machine learning and natural language processing techniques and &lt;a href="https://qz.com/work/1546565/the-emails-that-brought-down-enron-still-shape-our-daily-lives/"&gt;continues to be used&lt;/a&gt; to this&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want something a bit more fun? You can sign up to receive &lt;a href="https://enron.email"&gt;225,000 Enron emails in chronological order&lt;/a&gt; over a period of 7, 14 or 28&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m now reading &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41771517-limited-wish"&gt;Limited Wish&lt;/a&gt; by Mark Lawrence, the sequel to One Word Kill &lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190930-weekly-reading.html"&gt;which I read last week&lt;/a&gt;. This one&amp;#8217;s going to be a bit of a palate cleanser after all the accounting fraud I read&amp;nbsp;about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all the digital marketers out there, on October 1st, the Court of Justice of the European Union made a ruling on the use of cookies, the wording is remarkably clear and unambiguous and leaves us in no doubt as to what the correct way of dealing with cookies&amp;nbsp;is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today’s judgment, the Court decides that the consent which a website user must give to the storage of and access to cookies on his or her equipment is not validly constituted by way of a prechecked checkbox which that user must deselect to refuse his or her&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That decision is unaffected by whether or not the information stored or accessed on the user’s equipment is personal data. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; law aims to protect the user from any interference with his or her private life, in particular, from the risk that hidden identifiers and other similar devices enter those users’ terminal equipment without their&amp;nbsp;knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s wait and see if anyone actually changes their behaviour, eh&amp;nbsp;🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note it&amp;#8217;s time to look at &lt;a href="http://www.consentfultech.io/"&gt;Conseful Tech&lt;/a&gt; again, a project that aims to raise awareness around building technology that obeys digital consent. Their definition of consent is well worth paying attention&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of very useful looking email tools were released last week that are well worth checking out. These are &lt;a href="https://www.milliner.app/"&gt;Milliner&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/span&gt; email editor and &lt;a href="https://alter.email/"&gt;alter.email&lt;/a&gt;, a kitchen sink of useful tools for cleaning your email &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, I&amp;#8217;ve probably talked the ears off about my problems sleeping due to noise (from flatmates and whatever other random noise). Our world is getting noisier and with that comes a whole host of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/11/the-end-of-silence/598366/"&gt;negative effects to our health and general well being&lt;/a&gt;, and things may only get worse from hereon&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of many similar tools, but &lt;a href="https://sheet.best"&gt;sheet.best&lt;/a&gt; seems like a great way to build a simple prototype or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MVP&lt;/span&gt;, turning a Google Sheet into a simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ted Goas makes a compelling argument for &lt;a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-business-case-for-good-design-31356308f10a#4504"&gt;the business case for good design&lt;/a&gt;. Good design is something we can all explicitly experience and understand, it creates trust and frequently ends up as a signal booster for your marketing and advertising campaigns. Good design is a key brand differentiator and should absolutely be invested&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This segues quite nicely into Wistia&amp;#8217;s recent &lt;a href="https://wistia.com/learn/marketing/introducing-brand-affinity-marketing"&gt;Brand Affinity Marketing&lt;/a&gt; campaign. Much like Hubspot before them with their now ubiquitous &amp;#8220;Inbound Marketing&amp;#8221; methodology, Wistia are trying to create a new marketing buzzword around what they call Brand Affinity - which is simply just another way of looking at content marketing. There&amp;#8217;s nothing groundbreaking here, but Wistia have long been one of the great &lt;span class="caps"&gt;B2B&lt;/span&gt; content marketing brands. This campaign is going to be a useful case study, much like Hubspot&amp;#8217;s before&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weekly Reading</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190930-weekly-reading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-10-06T14:33:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-10-06T14:33:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-10-06:/writing/20190930-weekly-reading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Pardon the&amp;nbsp;hiatus&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m back, hot off the heels of a week spent in Morocco. It was my second time there (following a trip last year) and I&amp;#8217;m already thinking about when I can get there again next year, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamacyborg/status/1180803522113216512"&gt;I  need more rugs&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being away for so long gave me lots of time to catch up on reading, two weeks ago I was finishing Scott Galloway&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36166396-the-four"&gt;The Four: The Hidden &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google&lt;/a&gt; which was a fascinating read. If you&amp;#8217;ve been keeping up with the recent WeWork madness you&amp;#8217;ve probably heard of Scott Galloway, his analysis of Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon in this book is insightful and thoroughly entertaining. While he focuses on the eponymous big four, he also provides some critical analysis of smaller (relative to the big four) companies like Uber which is well worth sinking your teeth&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four thousand Uber employees and their investors will split $80 billion (or more) as the 1,600,000 drivers working for Uber will see their wages crash to a level that makes them the working poor. We used to admire firms that created hundreds of thousands of middle- and upper-class jobs; now our heroes are firms that produce a dozen lords and hundreds of thousands of&amp;nbsp;serfs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully surprising no one (I&amp;#8217;m a massive dork), I&amp;#8217;ve also been keeping up with the &lt;em&gt;12 years in the making&lt;/em&gt; Horus Heresy series from Games Workshop. &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45734813-the-solar-war"&gt;The Solar War&lt;/a&gt; is the first part of the Siege of Terra subseries and book number 55 in the &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/40983-the-horus-heresy"&gt;overall series&lt;/a&gt; (not including all the novellas and Primarch books). I don&amp;#8217;t know how, but 55+ books in and I&amp;#8217;m still a huge fan of the fictional world Games Workshop have managed to create. There&amp;#8217;s a case study yet to be written about their use of the White Dwarf magazine as an acquisition and content marketing&amp;nbsp;powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having read an article from Marty Cagan &lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190909-weekly-reading.html"&gt;a couple weeks ago&lt;/a&gt;, I just had to read &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35249663-inspired"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INSPIRED&lt;/span&gt;: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love&lt;/a&gt;, a book about effective product management in modern tech companies. In short, it thoroughly lived up to it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been not-so-secretly working away at a product idea for a number of months now, and this book gave me the kick up the arse I needed to step back into gear with it and provided some real actionable insights to build it more effectively. This is absolutely a must-read for anyone working in a tech company or for anyone thinking of building their own&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Lawrence is one of my favourite fantasy authors and his first foray into sci-fi with &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40383616-one-word-kill"&gt;One Word Kill&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t disappoint. A fun time-travelling jaunt set in the 80&amp;#8217;s. It&amp;#8217;s not as adult as his fantasy trilogies but was a nice quick and entertaining read, particularly after the last three&amp;nbsp;books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I read John Doerr&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37902327-measure-what-matters"&gt;Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with Okrs&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ve started a very slight roll-out of OKRs at work and I wanted to know what it was all about. I highly recommend reading it alongside Marty Cagan&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INSPIRED&lt;/span&gt; - Cagan talks frequently about OKRs but never goes into much detail so this is a great companion and a great resource for your professional&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascinatingly, Doerr does a deep dive on YouTube&amp;#8217;s obsession with increasing their daily watch time to 1 billion hours per day and yet somehow, despite mentioning ethics in the book more than once, he manages to completely ignore the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html"&gt;deeply disturbing algorithm changes&lt;/a&gt; that got them there. When a company focuses for so long on a single objective, and this was a 4 year objective for YouTube, it&amp;#8217;s easy to see how ethical constraints can easily be disregarded as staff become increasingly desperate to hit their&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of unethical companies,  I&amp;#8217;m ~50% through Bethany McLean&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19228776-the-smartest-guys-in-the-room"&gt;The Smartest Guys in the Room&lt;/a&gt;, an engrossing postmortem of Enron. Hopefully I&amp;#8217;ll be able to talk about it next&amp;nbsp;week!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;ve been away from a proper screen for a solid week, here are the better articles I came across while I was sitting&amp;nbsp;pool-side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brick and mortar’s troubles have been laid at the feet of digital disruption. There is some truth to that. However, digital sales are still only 12 percent of retail. It’s not stores that are dying, but the middle class, and the stores serving them. Most that are located in, or serving, middle-class households are struggling. By comparison, stores in affluent neighborhoods are holding strong. The middle class used to be 61 percent of Americans. Now they are the minority, representing less than half the population … the rest being lower or upper&amp;nbsp;income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to come once it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kicked this week off reading about the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/style/oh-behave.html"&gt;fragility of Silicon Valley&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, their inability to deal with important and valid criticism. I wonder how we&amp;#8217;ll see this one play out with the &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7982/adam-neumann-wework-absurd"&gt;unfolding WeWork drama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve done &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of job hopping over the years, so I found &lt;a href="https://qz.com/work/1704125/what-actually-motivates-people-at-work/"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Quartz fascinating, and led to a fair bit of self reflection on just &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#8217;d chosen to leave certain employers. I think that&amp;#8217;d have to be the subject of a whole other article if I were to go into it&amp;nbsp;though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spend any amount of time playing video games and you&amp;#8217;re likely to come across a whole range of user interfaces, but video games can provide inspiration outside of their own context, as &lt;a href="https://jenson.org/games/"&gt;Scott Jenson wonderfully explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google search is broken, would it be possible to &lt;a href="https://bradleytaunt.com/better-search-results/"&gt;bring trust back into the equation&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the idea of bespoke clothing, but &lt;a href="https://www.permanentstyle.com/2019/09/is-bespoke-worth-it.html"&gt;is it worth it&lt;/a&gt;? I guess that depends on what your definition of &lt;strong&gt;it&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m writing this from a personal website, so I guess it shouldn&amp;#8217;t come as any surprise, but I really enjoyed reading Tobias Van Schneider&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.vanschneider.com/a-love-letter-to-personal-websites"&gt;love letter to the personal&amp;nbsp;website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding religious about this, and maybe I am, our personal websites are our temples. They remain the one space on the internet where we decide how we are introduced to friends, potential employees and strangers. It’s a place where we can express, on our terms, who we are and what we&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my first job in email marketing in October &amp;#8216;11 and one of the first resources I came across was Laura and Steve Atkins&amp;#8217; Word to the Wise. Ever since, it&amp;#8217;s been a great resource I&amp;#8217;ve used to stay on top of what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world of deliverability, even if a lot of it mostly goes over my head. Articles like this one on &lt;a href="https://wordtothewise.com/2019/09/when-you-cant-get-a-response/"&gt;what to do if you can&amp;#8217;t get a response from a postmaster team&lt;/a&gt; provide great actionable advice you absolutely should learn&amp;nbsp;from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7929/the-square-credit-card-reader-sound-is-dissonant-and-terrifying"&gt;The hills are alive with the sound of money&lt;/a&gt;. Ever wondered what your credit card sounds like? The answer lies in those old Square&amp;nbsp;dongles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably comes as no surprise to the #emailgeeks community who&amp;#8217;ve seen me banging on about yoga for a year - but it turns out &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1307380/yoga-and-meditation-boost-your-ego-say-psychology-researchers/?"&gt;yoga practitioners may not be as chill as they like to claim they are&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;artnet published their third &lt;a href="http://www.artnet.com/artnet-intelligence-report/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on the latest trends in the art market. There are some real insights in here worth looking&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$46,281
The average price of an artwork
sold at auction in the first half
of 2019—28 percent less than in
the equivalent period last year,
when the average price hit $61,699.
What happened? For the first time
in several years, the number
of works sold at auction is going
up while total sales are going
down. There are simply fewer
high-priced outliers to drive up
the average&amp;nbsp;price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sticking to the subject of art, I can already hear the gnashing of teeth over &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/hillary-clinton-reads-emails-venice-art-show-1648867"&gt;but her&amp;nbsp;emails&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know anything about concrete, but I know &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/design/2019/09/kennedy-center-reach-steven-holl-concrete-build-material/597562/"&gt;I like this type&lt;/a&gt;. I think a trip to the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts is in order if I ever find myself in D.C, the building expansion looks&amp;nbsp;incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve got until December 13th to enter the &lt;a href="https://www.dpnetwork.org.uk/Awards/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPN&lt;/span&gt; Rosemary Smith Award for Responsible Marketing&lt;/a&gt;. If you or your team are fighting the good fight and trying to engage in effective marketing while protecting the data rights of your customers you could stand to win&amp;nbsp;£1,000.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weekly Reading</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190909-weekly-reading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-17T19:23:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-17T19:23:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-09-17:/writing/20190909-weekly-reading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Better late than&amp;nbsp;never?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#8217;s been pretty productive on the book reading front, I quickly worked my way through Orwell&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24104049-why-i-write"&gt;Why I Write&lt;/a&gt; which was fascinating, albeit the British stereotyping quickly became tiresome. I found it interesting to compare Orwell&amp;#8217;s views on British and European values and the rise of fascism across Europe - things that worryingly have been on the rise in recent&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first came across Yanis Varoufakis&amp;#8217; work back when he &lt;a href="http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/"&gt;worked at Valve&lt;/a&gt;, the video game company (back when they still made games) and thoroughly enjoyed the few blogs he posted there. So when I was browsing the Economics section of Waterstones I was drawn to his book, &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39808472-talking-to-my-daughter"&gt;A Brief History of Capitalism&lt;/a&gt;. I know next to nothing in economics, so this was precisely the dumbed down view I needed to dip my toe into the&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve heard and read a lot about Eric Ries&amp;#8217; &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12969026-the-lean-startup"&gt;Lean Startup&lt;/a&gt; in the last few years, so it provided some interesting and rather light reading when I was abroad in Granada. I&amp;#8217;m working on a lil&amp;#8217; something something so there was a lot to take away from this, particularly around the value of quickly developing and testing an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MVP&lt;/span&gt;, something I hope to have done by the end of the year&amp;nbsp;👀&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;#8217;m now reading Scott Galloway&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36166396-the-four"&gt;The Four: The Hidden &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google&lt;/a&gt;. More thoughts to follow next&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profitwell continue to bring out some of the most well-researched and produced content out there, and &lt;a href="https://www.profitwell.com/blog/how-do-discounts-impact-growth"&gt;this piece on discounting&lt;/a&gt; certainly didn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discounts are one of the worst tactics you can use to grow your business, because like a virus they’re a ticking time bomb for your&amp;nbsp;growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite what you&amp;#8217;ve read elsewhere, and what you&amp;#8217;re probably thinking, &lt;a href="https://going-medieval.com/2019/08/02/i-assure-you-medieval-people-bathed/"&gt;medieval people bathed&lt;/a&gt;, as Dr Eleanor Janega explains quite authoritatively. Not quite the smelly peasants we think about,&amp;nbsp;eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something I&amp;#8217;m sure a lot of people working in tech have come across, but what actually are product teams? Marty Cagan puts together a compelling case to explain the difference between &lt;a href="https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/"&gt;product and feature teams&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a great article in the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/16/superfans-a-love-story"&gt;New Yorker&lt;/a&gt; on what modern fandom means and how it came to be. Not going to lie, superfans weird me&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-voter-data"&gt;Boris is trying to fuck us&lt;/a&gt;. Is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt; going to come to our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ICOnews/status/1172085036012711936"&gt;rescue&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve all come across poorly implemented browser Push notifications, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be that way Stephanie Walker wrote the perfect guide on &lt;a href="https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-not-fck-up-push-notifications/"&gt;how to not fuck up push notifications&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking anecdotally, my team at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DM&lt;/span&gt; Companies implemented these on one of the sites we worked on. For our use case, we saw a consistent uplift vs the same message delivered via email. This is absolutely a channel that can work dramatically well, just be responsible with it,&amp;nbsp;duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bit short this week huh? I spent a long weekend in Granada - the Alhambra is fucking incredible. Get your head away from your screen and go visit&amp;nbsp;sometime.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weekly Reading</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190902-weekly-reading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-08T19:02:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-08T19:02:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-09-08:/writing/20190902-weekly-reading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Far indeed is this from the&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may have seen the &lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190819-weekly-reading.html"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190826-weekly-reading.html"&gt;couple&lt;/a&gt; of weeks, I&amp;#8217;ve been slowly plodding through Catherine Nixey&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35450727-the-darkening-age"&gt;The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World&lt;/a&gt;. It turned out to be a deeply frustrating read ⁠— the topic is one that is fascinating; namely the destruction of the classical world by the rise of Christianity within the Roman Empire. The frustration begins and ends with the writing, Nixey is quick to turn the subject into an emotional argument, which given the sheer breadth of the art and knowledge we lost at the hands of the early Christians is understandable but frustrating when you&amp;#8217;re trying to separate fact from&amp;nbsp;fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s clear is that modern society has suffered hugely at the hands of Christianity, with the loss of uncounted books, the maiming of priceless statuary, the wholesale destruction of ancient Roman and Greek temples and the murder of philosophers, scientists and mathematicians (and more, of course) at the hands of roving illiterate and uneducated Christians. This religious madness continues unabated, of course, with ancient sites across Syria, Iraq and Libya &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destruction_of_cultural_heritage_by_ISIL"&gt;suffering at the hands of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISIL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Plus ça&amp;nbsp;change&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also read &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/81779.The_Symposium"&gt;Plato&amp;#8217;s Symposium&lt;/a&gt;, which, while short, provided a bit of a palate cleanser after the last book. I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure what to think about it, in all honesty ⁠— I&amp;#8217;m not well enough read to provide any real fundamental criticism other than I enjoyed it. I find it fascinating how far society regressed in ~600 years from this to the depths of Christian destruction of everything Plato and his peers&amp;nbsp;built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked up a couple of the books in Penguin&amp;#8217;s Great Ideas series, the first of which was Lao Tzu&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6324044-tao-te-ching"&gt;Tao Te Ching&lt;/a&gt;. Much like The Symposium, I&amp;#8217;m not well read enough to really break this down, however it&amp;#8217;s certainly a starting point and I&amp;#8217;ll be looking for some broader books on Taoism that can break down the subject for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I particularly enjoyed Chapter&amp;nbsp;44:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your name or your person, &lt;br/&gt;
Which is dearer? &lt;br/&gt;
Your person or your goods, &lt;br/&gt;
Which is worth more? &lt;br/&gt;
Gain or loss, &lt;br/&gt;
Which is a greater bane? &lt;br/&gt;
That is why excessive meanness &lt;br/&gt;
Is sure to lead to great expense; &lt;br/&gt;
Too much store &lt;br/&gt;
Is sure to end in immense loss. &lt;br/&gt;
Know contentment &lt;br/&gt;
And you will suffer no disgrace; &lt;br/&gt;
Know when to stop &lt;br/&gt;
And you will meet with no danger. &lt;br/&gt;
You can then endure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, in the same series as the last book I&amp;#8217;m reading Orwell&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24104049-why-i-write"&gt;Why I Write&lt;/a&gt;. More to come on that subject next week, I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;#8217;ve been reading a lot of the content the folks at Basecamp have published - an article titled &lt;a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/lets-bury-the-hustle/"&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s Bury the Hustle&lt;/a&gt; struck a particular chord with me. I&amp;#8217;ve always found keeping a healthy work-life balance to be challenging, so it&amp;#8217;s a breath of fresh air to see a company championing the idea that work is just work, maybe it&amp;#8217;s time to experience life&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seemed only natural that I&amp;#8217;d be interested in &lt;a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-7-ancient-roman-sculptures"&gt;an article on ancient Roman sculptures&lt;/a&gt; after finishing Nixey&amp;#8217;s book. The title of &amp;#8220;7 Ancient Roman Sculptures You Need to Know&amp;#8221; is laughable, but apparently that&amp;#8217;s the only way to get people interested in this&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excel announced a new &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Excel-Blog/Announcing-XLOOKUP/ba-p/811376"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XLOOKUP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function. It seems like a pretty solid replacement for the endless &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INDEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATCH&lt;/span&gt; formulas I&amp;#8217;d normally use across my&amp;nbsp;spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capitalist surveillance state continues unabated, Brave - a privacy focused web browser discovered some decidedly &lt;a href="https://djmag.com/longreads/facial-recognition-technology-coming-club-near-you"&gt;not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; compliant&lt;/a&gt; behaviour from the hands of Google, clubs in London are being forced to adopt &lt;a href="https://djmag.com/longreads/facial-recognition-technology-coming-club-near-you"&gt;facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt; in their venues by local councils and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAB&lt;/span&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://iabtechlab.com/blog/evolution-of-internet-identity-privacy-tracking/"&gt;laughable attempt&lt;/a&gt; at whitewashing their criminal behaviour by begging for the government to allow them to track individuals, all in the name of pushing unwanted ads into the face of uncaring&amp;nbsp;consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LINC&lt;/span&gt; (Laboratoire d’Innovation Numérique de la &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNIL&lt;/span&gt; - the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNIL&lt;/span&gt; being the French regulatory body for data protection) wrote about a framework through which to &lt;a href="https://linc.cnil.fr/dark-patterns-quelle-grille-de-lecture-pour-les-reguler"&gt;regulate dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; on the web. The article is in French but well worth a read via your translation service of&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what happened to Bebo? The folks at Gizmodo wrote &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/why-these-social-networks-failed-so-badly-1836996164"&gt;a great obituary&lt;/a&gt; for all those social networks of old. The web sure seemed like a more innocent and exciting place back in those Myspace&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is science sexist? It appears that &lt;a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-09-analysis-science-sexist.html"&gt;the answer is yes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make no secret of how frustrating I find bottomless optimism and cheerfulness. Maybe instead of running away from &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7906/toxicity-actually-good"&gt;&amp;#8220;toxic&amp;#8221; thought&lt;/a&gt;, we should embrace it to make something better of&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, I&amp;#8217;m going to leave you with an article about &lt;a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/09/inspired-design-decisions-alexey-brodovitch/"&gt;Alexey Brodovitch&lt;/a&gt; and how you can mirror his iconic work through modern web&amp;nbsp;techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, the email designer in me is crying at the lost opportunity&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weekly Reading</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190826-weekly-reading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-02T18:05:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-09-02T18:05:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-09-02:/writing/20190826-weekly-reading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A day late but who&amp;#8217;s counting&amp;nbsp;anyway?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; working my way through Catherine Nixey&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35450727-the-darkening-age"&gt;The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World&lt;/a&gt;, a couple days to go and it&amp;#8217;ll be done with it 🤞. It&amp;#8217;s not a bad book per say, but, well, I guess I&amp;#8217;ll get into it next week when I&amp;#8217;m done with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started this week off by reading an article on &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/opinion/shipping-container-homes.html"&gt;shipping containers&lt;/a&gt;, specifically their use in architecture. I don&amp;#8217;t think a better symbol of the global economy exists, but I sure as shit wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to live in&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article&amp;#8217;s being doing the rounds of the email community since it was published early last month, but I&amp;#8217;ve been a bit slow on the uptake. &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/was-e-mail-a-mistake"&gt;Was e-mail a mistake?&lt;/a&gt; Using a hyphen in email certainly is, but let&amp;#8217;s ignore that glaring oversight. I&amp;#8217;ve never been in a position where I find myself inundated by a million emails at work and I&amp;#8217;ve certainly never been one of those inbox zero folks (as the 47k unread emails in my promo tab can tell you) but increasingly I understand the frustration of being inundated by endless messages and notifications from other services. This article doesn&amp;#8217;t talk about the attention economy, but that&amp;#8217;s precisely what it&amp;#8217;s about. It&amp;#8217;s not an email problem and we need to look at the bigger picture and realise that it&amp;#8217;s a lifestyle&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve started seeing contactless donation points dotted around the city, most recently at the Wallace Collection, but as we move towards an increasingly cashless society it&amp;#8217;s nice to see them being used for &lt;a href="https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/34263/city-of-london-installs-contactless-donation-points-to-help-rough-sleepers"&gt;charitable causes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-08-14/san-francisco-scoot-tenderloin-bird"&gt;Not all is good in scooter land&lt;/a&gt; with high-poverty areas of San Fracisco not being served by Scoot, despite promises being made to the&amp;nbsp;contrary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renowned fashion designer Ann Demeulemeester&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/style/ann-demeulemeester-doesnt-miss-fashion-at-all-she-has-other-plans.html"&gt;enjoying the country life&lt;/a&gt; and making some gorgeous homeware in the&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jeffrey Epstein story keeps unfolding, with news surfacing of &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/154826/jeffrey-epsteins-intellectual-enabler"&gt;John Brockman&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; involvement in Epstein&amp;#8217;s opaque world. This is a fascinating read on how the world&amp;#8217;s of culture, science and finance collide and one agent&amp;#8217;s involvement in the very middle of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever see a story about a weird patent filed by a tech company? Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2019/08/amazon-sony-facebook-strange-patents.html"&gt;the reason why&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G7 summit was held in Biarritz last week (24-26th August), &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/26/biarritz-g7-syria-us-china-trade"&gt;is it still fit for purpose&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derek, aka Die, Workwear wrote an excellent article on the &lt;a href="https://dieworkwear.com/post/187176321489/the-slow-death-of-glamour"&gt;Slow Death of Glamour&lt;/a&gt;, following the recent bankruptcy filing of Barneys and the tectonic shift in fashion marketing we&amp;#8217;ve seen in the last decade from glossy fashion magazines to social media&amp;nbsp;influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the real problem is that the age of authenticity killed our ability to believe in glamour. Without any reason to go to Barney’s physical locations, getting out of the house just became an extra step to acquire something you can get&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7867/a-good-place-every-noise-at-once-does-its-darnedest-to-create-order-out-of-chaos"&gt;The Outline&lt;/a&gt; I discovered a fascinating project called &lt;a href="http://everynoise.com/"&gt;Every Noise at Once&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to map out all of the various musical genres that can be found on Spotify. So far it&amp;#8217;s a really fun way of discovering new music that sounds similar to stuff I&amp;#8217;m already&amp;nbsp;into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering investing in Uber? Yeah, &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1693843/uber-eats-will-lose-money-until-at-least-2024-say-cowen-analysts/"&gt;you probably shouldn&amp;#8217;t do that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Moneylab, their latest challenge is to &lt;a href="https://www.moneylab.co/mrr/"&gt;reach $15k in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MRR&lt;/span&gt; in 6 months&lt;/a&gt;, you should follow their progress, you&amp;#8217;re sure to learn something on the&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, and unashamedly taken from that last article, &lt;a href="https://justinjackson.ca/costs"&gt;let&amp;#8217;s talk about startup costs&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;m working on a &amp;#8216;lil project right now (👀) and this was a much needed&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tracking debates continue unabated, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/23/opinion/data-internet-privacy-tracking.html"&gt;Farhad Manjoo shows us&lt;/a&gt; just how much data can be slurped up in a few web browsing sessions. On a similar line the clowns at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAB&lt;/span&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2019/08/21/iab-europe-issues-updated-gdpr-compliancy-protocol"&gt;desperate to save their skin&lt;/a&gt;, here&amp;#8217;s hoping the &lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/digital-marketing-post-gdpr.html"&gt;recent cookie guidance&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt; puts the final nail in the online ad industry&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;coffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and finally, hot off the back of &lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190819-weekly-reading.html"&gt;last week&amp;#8217;s book finish&lt;/a&gt; (On China by Henry Kissinger), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QZ&lt;/span&gt; have published a &lt;a href="https://qz.com/africa/1686069/chinas-growing-presence-in-africa/"&gt;thorough breakdown&lt;/a&gt; on China&amp;#8217;s increasing economic presence on the African&amp;nbsp;continent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just over two decades, China has grown to become the biggest foreign player on the continent. It is now Africa’s largest trade partner, its largest infrastructure funder, and its fastest-growing source of foreign direct investment, pledging $60 billion in 2018 versus just $5 billion in 2006. Top officials from China regularly tour the continent, with premiers and foreign ministers making 79 visits to 43 different states between 2007 and 2017, according to consultancy Development&amp;nbsp;Reimagined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last June, to the surprise of many, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adam_rose/status/1140151337834962944"&gt;a Tweet&lt;/a&gt; was widely shared online, showing the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt; admitting that their own cookie policy &amp;#8220;doesn&amp;#8217;t meet the required &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;standard&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early July, this was followed up with &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-pecr/guidance-on-the-use-of-cookies-and-similar-technologies/"&gt;new guidance on cookie usage&lt;/a&gt; that clearly exposes the way the industry has been mistreating customer data, and the ways we need to&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Digital Marketing&amp;nbsp;Today&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#8217;s take a look at some ways digital marketers collect&amp;nbsp;data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Form&amp;nbsp;Submission&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, data collected when a user submits a form is often used in marketing, for example an email address collected via a form will typically be sent marketing emails, or shared with Facebook to receive targeted advertising. It is not always explicitly explained at the point of form submission what data will be used for what and where the collected data may end up being sent&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cookies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Sites will typically use a cookie-based analytics tool, such as Google Analytics to identify how individuals use a website. This allows them to see precisely what pages an individual has visited, what elements of the website they&amp;#8217;ve interacted with, what devices they&amp;#8217;re using to access the site, where they&amp;#8217;re physically located (via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;), etc. Typically, this information is collected by third party services such as Google or&amp;nbsp;Adobe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalisation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  These cookies are used to collect precise behavioural information about a unique individual. For example, knowing what someone has added to their shopping basket on an ecommerce site, or keeping track of what pages someone has looked at to build up a personalised behavioural profile to later target them with more direct product messaging. These cookies can be first or third party, meaning that information is often sent off to opaque third party services that provide some form of personalisation engine to the&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retargeting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Cookies like Facebook or Google Doubleclick (amongst others) collect information on an individual&amp;#8217;s website visit for the purpose of later identifying that individual across multiple separate websites which allows the cookie owner to build up a large data profile on the individual. Examples of the type of information collected are&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Age&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Location&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behaviour on your&amp;nbsp;website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behaviour on search&amp;nbsp;engines&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behaviour on social&amp;nbsp;media&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  This data collection happens in the background of most websites and tends to be incredibly opaque as to how and what data is collected specifically and where it is sent&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advertising&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  Due to the way advertising works online, a publisher (a site or app running adverts) typically uses an auction system to determine which adverts to display to an individual user. This auction system involves sending data back and forth from the website to numerous online advertising exchanges to determine which specific advert should be shown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It should therefore come as no surprise that this process allows advertisers to create highly specific profiles of individuals and their behaviour online as they collect data through this auction&amp;nbsp;mechanism.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Telemetry&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you use applications on your desktop,mobile or on the web, information about your specific interactions with the product may be recorded and sent directly to the product developer, for example to understand what specifically you have interacted with. &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2014/03/20/instrumenting-your-app-for-telemetry-and-analytics/"&gt;Microsoft calls this data a &amp;#8220;gold mine&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&amp;nbsp;Tracking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you receive a marketing email from a company, the email will contain tracking pixels telling the sender when (and often where and with what device) you open the email. They also contain tracking links allowing them to know specifically what an individual has clicked on in a received email. Furthermore the email may also contain additional third party tracking which function like the retargeting and advertising cookies mentioned&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Data&amp;nbsp;brokerage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies like Experian and Equifax allow others to purchase personal information about you so that they can then target you for marketing. This frequently occurs without your knowledge or&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list and brands and marketers continue to innovate in the ways in which they can acquire your data without your express knowledge or&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken in combination, you can see how a business can quickly start to build an incredibly detailed view of an individual, how they can start to access that data directly as a first party or even start to target individuals through data held by third parties, such as when running advertising&amp;nbsp;campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostensibly, marketers like to tell themselves that this is all above board – data is collected usually but not always for specific purposes and this data provides value to the business and hopefully (we like to tell ourselves) to the individual. The problem is in the opaqueness of the processes involved and the lack of consent or even knowledge by the end-user about the scope of the data collection taking&amp;nbsp;place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what are we doing with all this&amp;nbsp;data?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Programmatic&amp;nbsp;Advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising based on individual user profiles and website placement. Look at any news website or your Instagram feed and you&amp;#8217;ll see this in&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retargeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to programmatic but based explicitly on targeting people who&amp;#8217;ve performed a specific action that has been tracked, such as looking at a particular&amp;nbsp;product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targeted&amp;nbsp;Advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending email addresses or phone numbers to Google or Facebook so that individuals can be specifically targeted or lookalike audiences can be built based on a specific subset of customers provided by email address or phone&amp;nbsp;number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&amp;nbsp;Marketing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending emails to individuals to get them to perform a specific action, such as signing up to your product or purchasing your latest&amp;nbsp;widget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to email, but via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;. For example informing your customers of a sale or for shorter and more actionable&amp;nbsp;messaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Push&amp;nbsp;notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like email but frequently based on more specific actions having occurred in an app, for example someone responding to a message you posted on social media or an action taking place in a mobile&amp;nbsp;game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look at data collected from telemetry and various cookies to optimise our products and our sales&amp;nbsp;funnels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Nothing at&amp;nbsp;all&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes businesses collect  data and just let it sit in a database without doing anything with it, go figure&amp;nbsp;🤷‍♂️&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is by no means an exhaustive list and is merely used to demonstrate some common scenarios in which data is used for&amp;nbsp;marketing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;d all like to think all this data is being handled carefully and responsibly, but ask any marketer and they&amp;#8217;ll have stories to tell about customer data being shared across the company through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSV&lt;/span&gt; files or the business &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRM&lt;/span&gt;, without any oversight or mechanism to protect an individual&amp;#8217;s private&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So where does that leave&amp;nbsp;us?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this new guidance, some things have become abundantly&amp;nbsp;clear:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot rely on implied consent to use&amp;nbsp;cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytics cookies require&amp;nbsp;consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Legitimate Interests cannot be used as a reason for processing analytics or advertising&amp;nbsp;cookies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; deal. Websites currently assume you consent to cookies until you tell them otherwise and will gleefully suck up as much data as they can collect until you stop them. This new guidance makes it explicitly clear that this is no longer allowed and that a business &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; obtain consent before they engage in these&amp;nbsp;activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead. Switch to a log-based analytics system and strip out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;. You might be able to obtain consent for your analytics cookies but hey, who am I kidding, we&amp;#8217;ve trained people to hit the big ❌ button on popups so they&amp;#8217;ll close your popup immediately without giving you&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Programmatic&amp;nbsp;advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll still be able to target people based on the website you wish to place an advert on, but advertising brokers will no longer have monolithic profiles of profiles you can target based on interests, demographics, etc. This is a big loss for businesses and a &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HUGE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; win for individual&amp;nbsp;privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Retargeting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead. Deader than dead. Good luck obtaining consent when you have to explain to your users that you want to stalk them around the web for products they spent all of 3 seconds looking at on your site. Good fucking&amp;nbsp;riddance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Targeted&amp;nbsp;Advertising&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dead. No one will want to give you consent to send off their personal data to third parties. Advertisers will also struggle to obtain interest and demographic data making lookalike audiences much less&amp;nbsp;valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Email&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/gdpr-email-tracking.html"&gt;Legitimate interest isn&amp;#8217;t good enough&lt;/a&gt;, you need to obtain consent for marketing emails&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and unless you have explicitly collected consent for tracking you cannot track how individuals behave within your&amp;nbsp;emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like email, you&amp;#8217;re going to need to collect consent to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; for marketing. There&amp;#8217;s some real opportunties to demonstrate the value of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; to customers here, you&amp;#8217;ll just have to think&amp;nbsp;creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Push&amp;nbsp;Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll need consent, but you already needed that. Push notifications are probably going to suffer the least because there have been solid mechanisms in place for years to prevent misuse from&amp;nbsp;marketers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Social&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to be paying Facebook or YouTube given what they&amp;#8217;re up&amp;nbsp;to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What happens&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big winners are going to be the channels which can most clearly communicate an obvious value exchange between the individual customer and the business. Unsurprisingly, given what I do, I think these are channels like email, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; and push notifications. Once you&amp;#8217;ve built an existing relationship with an individual, they are more likely to see the benefit in giving you permission to  message them via these&amp;nbsp;channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising(⚰️) in all forms is the clear loser - this new cookie guidance effectively put the nail in the coffin of digital advertising as we know it. You&amp;#8217;ll no longer be able to target individuals based on what pages of your website they&amp;#8217;ve visited or their interests, geographical location or demographic data. &lt;a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/company/advertising-and-affiliates/"&gt;DuckDuckGo already demonstrates&lt;/a&gt; how we can move towards a more compliant and a more ethical take on advertising. Budgets will inevitable suffer as performance decreases across digital advertising&amp;nbsp;channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer acquisition optimisation is going to suffer. Without clear analytics across the board we&amp;#8217;ll have to do a lot more work done to understand how individual campaigns have performed. There are plenty of ways we can do this, for example having personalised landing pages per campaign and measuring the aggregate number of visits to that page (ie without &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt; to identify unique visits) vs the number of purchases or form submissions. I think we&amp;#8217;ll see more investment in this area as gauging the effectiveness of our marketing spend becomes increasingly&amp;nbsp;challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marketers are going to have to adapt to these changes and we&amp;#8217;re going to have to take a very close look at how permission is currently obtained in mobile apps. It&amp;#8217;s clear that they&amp;#8217;re leading the way in this area and understand that progressively obtaining permission (consent, in our case) based on specific interactions (for example, asking for camera permissions when the app user wishes to take a photo in the app) is the way we&amp;#8217;re going to have to&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this purpose it behoves all of us in marketing to propose a new framework for ethical marketing and more purposeful and transparent data collection. It is a position of extreme arrogance on the behalf of marketers and businesses to believe that our bottom line is more important than an individual&amp;#8217;s privacy. What the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; has achieved with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; is making it clear that this is absolutely not the&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In an age in which marketing data is used to enable electoral fraud and strip our civil liberties, we need to do&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

Deeply insightful and provided some real perspective on the Communist Party of China and how confucianism still leads and influences modern policy in the country. Kissinger is entirely too easy on Mao and the millions of deaths he caused as a result of his policies and the political upheaval that he lead - but I certainly learnt a lot about the history of the country and &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; some of the diplomatic policies were the way that they were. A hugely fascinating read if you want to understand what&amp;#8217;s going on in the world right now and how we got&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started reading Catherine Nixey&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35450727-the-darkening-age"&gt;The Darkening Age: The Christian Destruction of the Classical World&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, it&amp;#8217;s, errrr, not off to a good start, but I&amp;#8217;ll hold off on my judgement until I&amp;#8217;ve read the whole&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the climate continues to be a pressing issue - immigration and mass migrations as a result of armed conflict have been serious issues for hundreds of years, but soon we&amp;#8217;ll start seeing these mass migrations occur as a result of climate change, with recent examples in &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7823/the-slow-erosion-of-northern-pakistan-batura-glacier-gilgit-baltistan-passu"&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/08/alexandria-climate-change-sea-level-canals-al-max-fishing/596593/"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; showing how glacial thawing and rising sea levels will impact people&amp;#8217;s lives and&amp;nbsp;livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We already know &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2015/02/rising-sea-levels-are-already-making-miamis-floods-worse/385619/"&gt;some of the damage&lt;/a&gt; this can cause, we need to do something about it &lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monoculture farming continues to be an environmental distaster, the most recent victim being the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/banana-disease-tr4-latin-america"&gt;humble banana&lt;/a&gt;, which is now threatened by a fungus that could kill the plant off&amp;nbsp;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now seems like a good time to familiarise yourself with Yvon Chouinard and how &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/patagonias-philosopher-king"&gt;his environmental beliefs&lt;/a&gt; have shaped the apparel company Patagonia. Business &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help us save the environment - but only if we consume less and are more thoughtful about our purchasing&amp;nbsp;habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve heard people talking about Morning Brew for a while now but &lt;a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/how-morning-brews-referral-program-built-an-audience-of-1-5-million-subscribers-3315482c1aa5"&gt;this article about their referral program&lt;/a&gt; is deeply insightful, without the toxic &amp;#8220;growthhacker&amp;#8221; mentality than you often see on topics like this. Covering everything from how they technically went about setting up the program to their reasoning behind their gift tiers, including breakdowns for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAC&lt;/span&gt;, there&amp;#8217;s a lot to learn from&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you&amp;#8217;re here, you should &lt;a href="https://www.morningbrew.com/daily/r/?kid=e4310460"&gt;sign up to their daily email&lt;/a&gt; as well (That&amp;#8217;s a referral link 😉, I want the&amp;nbsp;mug!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of Wikipedia, and some of the &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7749/creepy-wikipedia-explainer"&gt;absurd policies and fringe interests&lt;/a&gt; that run on the&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Wikipedia, did you know that it&amp;#8217;s built on an open source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt; platform called Mediawiki? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jacobian/status/1163453179499089921"&gt;Jacobian on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; got me thinking about the good old days, when you could get software running on a server without needing to understand command lines, containers, front end frameworks and all that other gubbins. It&amp;#8217;s still a language that&amp;#8217;s used all across the web, including &lt;a href="https://slack.engineering/taking-php-seriously-cf7a60065329"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe it&amp;#8217;s time we started taking it seriously&amp;nbsp;again?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Want to save capitalism? Maybe we should all just be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/opinion/business-roundtable.html"&gt;getting paid more&lt;/a&gt; so we can consume more, or, you know, consume more&amp;nbsp;ethically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videogame industry has a &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/7803/are-video-games-political-conservative-liberal"&gt;politics problem&lt;/a&gt;, and an audience that&amp;#8217;s too uneducated to understand that supporting the status quo is, in and of itself a political stance. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/18/the-mainstream-media-have-still-not-learned-the-lessons-of-gamergate/"&gt;Gamergate exposed an ugly underbelly&lt;/a&gt; to male hobby led online communities, and it appears some people have been taking note. Disney appear to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keefstuart/status/1164101226889383936"&gt;weaponising their audience&lt;/a&gt; in their recent failed negotiation attempts with Sony with regards to the Spider Man&amp;nbsp;franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the subject of corporate cowardice in the face of an increasingly politically aware society, &lt;a href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/media/we-will-continue-to-represent-men-at-their-best-gillettes-backflip-after-toxic-masculinity-backlash/news-story/8ae70a5abc31280fc23711dcf7c30e5e"&gt;Gilette just backtracked their &amp;#8220;toxic masculinity&amp;#8221; campaign&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched Netflix&amp;#8217;s The Great Hack a few weeks ago, while there were certainly no deep revelations if you&amp;#8217;ve been paying attention over the last couple years, it is beginning to &lt;a href="https://www.mumbrella.asia/2019/08/why-netflixs-the-great-hack-should-make-all-of-us-in-marketing-uncomfortable"&gt;expose the darker side of digital marketing&lt;/a&gt;. Big tech platforms are responsible for a lot of the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/11/world/americas/youtube-brazil.html"&gt;problems we&amp;#8217;re seeing in society today&lt;/a&gt;, so it should come as no surprise that &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/23/facebook-releases-new-cambridge-analytica-documents.html"&gt;Zuckerberg lied&lt;/a&gt; about Facebook&amp;#8217;s knowledge of what was going on with Cambridge Analytica&amp;#8217;s data&amp;nbsp;exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the communication, one of the employees called the Cambridge Analytica situation “hi pri” for high priority after The Guardian ran its article claiming the presidential campaign for Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was using data on Facebook users largely without their&amp;nbsp;consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping this stuff in mind, it&amp;#8217;s hard not to support Apple&amp;#8217;s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/sign-in-with-apple-goodbye-account-management/"&gt;obfuscate individual&amp;#8217;s email addresses&lt;/a&gt; when they sign up to services using Sign in with Apple. We&amp;#8217;ve proven time and time again that we can&amp;#8217;t be trusted with personal data and I think we can only expect services like this to become increasingly prevalent as these scandals continue to&amp;nbsp;unfold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology is advancing and opportunities are being created everywhere, it&amp;#8217;s hard not to look at something like &lt;a href="https://www.cityam.com/artificial-intelligence-marketing-and-phrasee/"&gt;Phrasee&lt;/a&gt; with optimism, we&amp;#8217;ll see some radical shifts in marketing when we can focus on the top-level strategy and leave the more tactical elements - like good writing - to tools better suited to the&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to only read viewpoints that come from a particular societal point of view, but we can only really learn and improve when we consider how other&amp;#8217;s see the world, something that &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1144408/bruce-lee-maximized-his-success-by-taking-the-best-of-both-eastern-and-western-philosophies"&gt;Bruce Lee&lt;/a&gt; understood better than&amp;nbsp;most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benek Lisefski writes that &lt;a href="https://modus.medium.com/data-driven-design-is-killing-our-instincts-d448d141653d"&gt;&amp;#8220;Data-Driven Design Is Killing Our Instincts&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and Tanner Christensen writes that &lt;a href="https://tannerchristensen.com/blog/2019/7/22/when-every-product-of-design-is-one-of-opinion"&gt;&amp;#8220;every product of design is one of opinion&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;, it seems to me like there&amp;#8217;s a middle ground to be reached where opinionated experience and data informs the creative&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a similar note, &lt;a href="https://leerob.io/blog/style-guides-component-libraries-design-systems/"&gt;Lee Robinson&lt;/a&gt; has an excellent breakdown of Style Guides and Design Systems. This one&amp;#8217;s well worth&amp;nbsp;bookmarking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://alistapart.com/article/the-career-management-document/"&gt;An article on A List Apart&lt;/a&gt; recently got me thinking about how I keep track of my career accomplishments and progress, I&amp;#8217;m going to start taking weekly notes to keep track of the big&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/aug/21/practice-does-not-always-make-perfect-violinists-10000-hour-rule"&gt;A recent article&lt;/a&gt; in the Guardians opens up with this great&amp;nbsp;sentence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With blatant disregard for the public benefits of motivational idioms, researchers have concluded that practice does not, necessarily, make&amp;nbsp;perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in these ideas, but sometimes practice for practice&amp;#8217;s sake is worth pursuing, even if you won&amp;#8217;t turn out to be an&amp;nbsp;expert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/life/2019/08/thomas-guide-los-angeles-history-street-map-google-waze-app/591721/"&gt;this article on maps&lt;/a&gt; is fascinating. It has been proven that &lt;a href="https://qz.com/977356/being-bilingual-makes-you-experience-time-differently/"&gt;the way we consume information shapes our perception of the world&lt;/a&gt;, maybe we&amp;#8217;ve lost a part of ourselves by relying on technology so&amp;nbsp;much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big shoutout to the folks at &lt;a href="http://actionrocket.co/"&gt;Action Rocket&lt;/a&gt; for the meetup this week. It was excellent as&amp;nbsp;always.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Weekly Reading</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20190812-weekly-reading.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-08-18T15:48:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-08-18T15:48:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-08-18:/writing/20190812-weekly-reading.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I finally finished The Inheritance of&amp;nbsp;Rome!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#8217;s been a good week, I was in Provence enjoying some much needed sunshine and rosé and catching up on some&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; finished &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7203544-the-inheritance-of-rome"&gt;The Inheritance of Rome&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;#8217;ve been reading since early July. I&amp;#8217;m not normally this slow at getting through a book, but this was one hell of an information-dense read. It&amp;#8217;s fascinating to see how the foundations of our modern world were set through this early Middle Ages period. It&amp;#8217;s a shame Ibn Hawqal&amp;#8217;s book on Sicilian idiocy has been lost to time, if only for the sheer pettiness of the&amp;nbsp;author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also finished was &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2595.Marketing_Warfare"&gt;Marketing Warfare&lt;/a&gt; by Al Ries which while interesting, I can&amp;#8217;t help but feel like the military anecdotes are a little trite. There&amp;#8217;s definitely a lot to unpack in there, and I found it helpful to have more strategic principles detailed in such a clear way. While the author ascribes these as marketing challenges (and maybe they were when this was published in &amp;#8216;85) it seems like business has changed and the challenges outlined are more to do with company strategy as opposed to pure marketing&amp;nbsp;strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That leaves me with Henry Kissinger&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14799927-on-china"&gt;On China&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;#8217;m ~80% through - more on that next&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news I had plenty of time to catch up on some more general reading, more on which&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it seems like some positive news regarding Facebook, in as much as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/08/08/749474600/users-can-sue-facebook-over-facial-recognition-software-court-rules?t=1566139785117"&gt;a court has decided that users can sue over their use of facial recognition technology&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, that&amp;#8217;s not the only issue they&amp;#8217;re facing this week with new information coming to light about &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-13/facebook-paid-hundreds-of-contractors-to-transcribe-users-audio"&gt;potentially sensitive user audio being listened to by human contractors&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook employing some &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/technology/facebook-antitrust.html"&gt;defensive warfare&lt;/a&gt; (See, I learnt something from that book) following a resurgence in calls for the company to be broken up by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like Facebook aren&amp;#8217;t the only ones in hot water over creepy facial recognition tech, unknown to pretty much everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42d087fa-bf79-11e9-89e2-41e555e96722"&gt;King&amp;#8217;s Cross station was using the technology too&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/14/major-breach-found-in-biometrics-system-used-by-banks-uk-police-and-defence-firms"&gt;major breach&lt;/a&gt; has been found in Biostar 2&amp;#8217;s systems, with more than a million people compromised.&amp;nbsp;🙃&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you hadn&amp;#8217;t already noticed, the world&amp;#8217;s falling apart. Mass tourism is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-08-12/tourism-is-overwhelming-the-world-s-top-destinations"&gt;creating issues&lt;/a&gt; (to put it lightly) in popular holiday spots and &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/environment/2019/08/potable-water-safe-to-drink-cities-global-south-drought-data/595966/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/opinion/opinion/why-new-york-city-needs-universal-internet-access.html"&gt;internet&lt;/a&gt; access in cities continues to be inadequate and only getting worse as demand continues to increase without adequate infrastructural investment. Germany appears to be entertaining some interesting ideas on a potential &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/8/11/20798683/meat-sin-tax-climate-change-animal-welfare-germany"&gt;&amp;#8220;sin tax&amp;#8221; on eating meat&lt;/a&gt;, it certainly seems like something worth considering given the ecological impact of animal&amp;nbsp;husbandry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if the climate weren&amp;#8217;t a big deal, Nike seems to think there&amp;#8217;s a need for a &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/08/12/business/nike-sneaker-subscription/index.html"&gt;subscription service&lt;/a&gt; giving kids 4 to 12 pairs of shoes a year. Given the crucial importance of &lt;a href="https://qz.com/quartzy/1670729/the-importance-of-clothing-resale-to-sustainable-fashion-in-2019/"&gt;decreasing the environmental impact of our fashion purchases&lt;/a&gt;, this seems like a particularly meaningful kick in the teeth from a company that pretends towards left-leaning&amp;nbsp;ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if all that wasn&amp;#8217;t bad enough, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/17/plastic-recycling-myth-what-really-happens-your-rubbish"&gt;recycling might not be as green as we all like to tell ourselves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733319301234#!"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; has been published exporing some of the issues in ensuring low-skilled workers benefit from increasing investment in high-tech jobs in Britain. Citylab has an &lt;a href="https://www.citylab.com/equity/2019/08/technology-employment-multiplier-effect-inequality-research/595291/"&gt;excellent breakdown&lt;/a&gt; on this issue. Unsurprisingly, it&amp;#8217;s not all sunshine and&amp;nbsp;rainbows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe we (as in the British) are &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/08/13/the-world-is-reaping-the-chaos-the-british-empire-sowed/"&gt;to blame&lt;/a&gt; for everything that&amp;#8217;s going&amp;nbsp;wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic has a great article on the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/08/arrogance-anthropocene/595795/"&gt;Anthropocene and human arrogance&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s well worth a&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The idea of the Anthropocene inflates our own importance by promising eternal geological life to our creations. It is of a thread with our species’ peculiar, self-styled exceptionalism—from the animal kingdom, from nature, from the systems that govern it, and from time itself. This illusion may, in the long run, get us all&amp;nbsp;killed.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know much about modern Russia, I&amp;#8217;m going to have to find some good books to read in the near future to understand why &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/10/thousands-march-in-moscow-disqualification-city-elections"&gt;events like this&lt;/a&gt; are&amp;nbsp;happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If, like me, you have more than a passing interest in tattoos, Artsy have a great article on &lt;a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-japanese-prints-inspired-tattoo-frenzy"&gt;Utagawa Kuniyoshi&amp;#8217;s influence&lt;/a&gt; on Japanese&amp;nbsp;tattooing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional thinking tells us that a good &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UX&lt;/span&gt; is one in which the number of clicks the user makes is minimised. But sometimes, &lt;a href="https://uxdesign.cc/why-you-should-forget-about-the-number-of-clicks-b80532475fae"&gt;that just ain&amp;#8217;t right&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe the problem is we&amp;#8217;re all used to &lt;a href="https://essays.uxdesign.cc/case-study-factory/"&gt;generic, formulaic thinking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quartz published an excellent article on some of the &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1657890/this-is-how-shopping-sites-trick-you-for-money-and-info/"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; we employ on ecommerce and similar sites. I get it, we use dark patterns because they work, but at some point we need to think about the moral and societal repercussions of our&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In brighter news&lt;/strong&gt;, two new experimental &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/12/health/ebola-outbreak-cure.html"&gt;treatments for Ebola&lt;/a&gt; are working well enough that they will now be offered to all patients in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DRC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jason Bailey&amp;#8217;s Artnome project has been on my radar for a couple years, this recent article showcases the &lt;a href="https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/7/24/generative-portraiture-of-espen-kluge"&gt;artwork of Espen Kluge&lt;/a&gt;, a Norwegian artist who uses generative algorithms to create abstract portraits. His work&amp;#8217;s both visually gorgeous and technically&amp;nbsp;fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you weren&amp;#8217;t asking but no, you still shouldn&amp;#8217;t trust big tech companies with your personal data. I hope regulatory bodies across Europe take leaf out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s book and start to impose some hefty fines on companies that keep doing this to&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#8217;s been to Brighton knows that seagulls are arseholes who&amp;#8217;ll swoop in and steal your bag of chips or doughnuts without a care in the world. Next time you find yourself face to beak with one of these rats of the coast, remember this sage&amp;nbsp;advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The study suggests gulls find the human gaze terrifying—and that they take human behavior into account when trawling the city for meals. The researchers say changes in human behavior may save us a chip or two—and help guide more effective gull conservation efforts. So, next time a pesky gull tries to steal your food, don’t run away; try having a staring contest with it&amp;nbsp;instead.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/epic-store-rage-has-gotten-out-of-hand-1837008625"&gt;Epic Store Rage Has Gotten Out Of&amp;nbsp;Hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamers. Sigh. The latest scandal in gaming is apparently developers daring to sell the game they&amp;#8217;ve made through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPIC&lt;/span&gt; game store instead of whatever other digital storefront. This is apparently &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; an affront that exceedingly special members of the gaming community have decided it&amp;#8217;s worth sending death and rape threats to developers. If you want to understand the rise of the alt-right and some of the tactics they use, looking at events like this and Gamergate will help make things&amp;nbsp;clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.revolvermag.com/music/slipknot-darkness-anger-addiction-behind-iowa-we-almost-all-died"&gt;Slipknot on Darkness, Anger, Addiction Behind ‘Iowa’: “We Almost All&amp;nbsp;Died”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer it was released, I spent weeks listening to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOWA&lt;/span&gt; by Slipknot on repeat while playing the Warhammer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUD&lt;/span&gt;, Wolfenburg. Anytime I hear it now, I get flashbacks to sitting at home staring at screens full of descriptive text, slowly typing my way to victory. This article was shared on the EmailGeeks slack by Waz and I immediately had to start listening to the album again, and yep, the flashbacks to that time were still in full&amp;nbsp;effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t a favourite of mine at the time by any means, but it&amp;#8217;s grown a lot on me and the stories the Slipknot crew tell about that time period are&amp;nbsp;fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAHAN&lt;/span&gt; Best time for me was when Sid was a little out of control, wouldn&amp;#8217;t get his shit down. He&amp;#8217;s like, &amp;#8220;I gotta go. My grandfather&amp;#8217;s dying. I gotta get there. Shit&amp;#8217;s going on.&amp;#8221; Grandpa dies. Didn&amp;#8217;t get there. Sid shows up. But we see he&amp;#8217;s hurting. He gets in [the recording booth]. They start the song. He starts singing. Next thing you know the song&amp;#8217;s done, he has a breakdown and that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;(515)&amp;#8221; [the intro of Iowa]. That&amp;#8217;s all Sid. Just gone. I come in the next day, Ross is weeping. Puts his arms around me. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for you, Clown. You&amp;#8217;re one of the few people that&amp;#8217;s gonna understand this. This is my favorite part of the record. It&amp;#8217;s the realest part of the record.&amp;#8221; It was Sid having a breakdown from all the pain in this thing called&amp;nbsp;Slipknot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you know, there are some deep flaws with Deepmind&amp;#8217;s health research. Unsurprisingly, feeding an algorithm gender biased data results in a gender biased model. Quelle surprise&amp;nbsp;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Google machine learning company trumpeted its success in predicting a deadly kidney condition, but its results raise questions around data rights and patient&amp;nbsp;diversity&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Profitwell always turn out excellent research, this is the latest example of that.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://qz.com/1680926/what-makes-nationalism-so-successful/"&gt;Nationalism is thriving using the very mechanism it&amp;nbsp;denounces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day, another hate crime perpetrated by an Angry White Man.  If you want to begin to understand what drives nationalism and fascism around the world, this article is well worth your&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;In July, the head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Erbas, declared that same-sex relationships constituted “heresy.” This is the same institution that in 2018 claimed on their website that girls as young as nine years old were spiritually ready to get married. One out of every three marriages in the country today involves underage girls, according to women’s rights groups. Cases of gender-based violence in Turkey escalated by 1,400% from 2002 to&amp;nbsp;2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I site Turkey because it gives us a salient example of how populist nationalism—and its next-in-line, populist authoritarianism—not only generates nativism and a systematic distrust of foreigners, but exacerbates sexism, misogyny and&amp;nbsp;homophobia.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://qz.com/work/1675000/how-to-achieve-a-big-career-goal-start-by-keeping-a-work-diary/"&gt;If you’ve got a big career goal, you need to start keeping a work&amp;nbsp;diary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate writing, I don&amp;#8217;t feel good at it and it feels like, at any moment, someone will realise I&amp;#8217;m as dumb as I sometimes feel I am. This article was a good kick in the arse for me to just get on with it and worry about it&amp;nbsp;later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Personal growth is perhaps the most important outcome of keeping a work diary, according to Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile and psychologist Steven Kramer, co-authors of the book The Progress Principle. As they explain in an article for the Harvard Business Review, they asked more than 200 knowledge workers to write in a diary for no more than 10 minutes a day while working on a complex project. While the participants said the exercise helped them stay focused and organized, they were especially struck by the psychological revelations that occurred to them as they&amp;nbsp;wrote.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/us/politics/trump-campaign-facebook-ads-invasion.html"&gt;How the Trump Campaign Used Facebook Ads to Amplify His ‘Invasion’&amp;nbsp;Claim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t been paying attention, America&amp;#8217;s got a white supremacy problem. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s got the lowdown on how Trump&amp;#8217;s inflammatory language has been used across more than 2,000 ads on Facebook and why that&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite working in email for the last 8 years, I still struggle to read email headers. This article is probably the best thing I&amp;#8217;ve read on the subject, hugely informative if you want to help others understand just why email is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sonniesedge.net/posts/real-dark-web/"&gt;The Real Dark&amp;nbsp;Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re active in online communities, particularly technical ones, it&amp;#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in the idea that everyone&amp;#8217;s doing the latest thing, this is as true in web design as it is in email&amp;nbsp;marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;They are the 99% of the web universe that is quietly getting on, not blogging about their technology stack, not publishing amazing new tooling. Simply building&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call them the 1% with purpose, in a deliberate evocation of the privileged 1% who run our planet (because I love to jump analogy mid post and to distort numbers). To be on a cutting edge team is a privilege. It means having resources and money and a lack of accountability that most web developers simply don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;have.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I recall watching the race with my dad in our sitting room in France, he was home from the hospital after a heavy bout of chemo and the loss of one of his heroes bought him to tears. A few months later, in December, he died&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close to 25 years later, a few weeks ago, his father passed away. In many ways, he was the father I never really had the luxury of having, pushing me into various sports, teaching me to read a clock, to speak to strangers and so much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see the rise of hateful father figures in society like Jordan Peterson. Cheerily leading vulnerable young white men towards paths of intolerance and hatred for others in the name of a quick buck. When simple advice like “clean your room” gets passed alongside race baiting &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/02/the-unwelcome-revival-of-race-science"&gt;“Race &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IQ&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/a&gt; lies and society turns inwards and backwards, sparking intolerance and attacks towards women, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/span&gt;+ community and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are we to do with all the angry young white&amp;nbsp;men?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you reading this might have seen me talk about this problem in the very excellent &lt;a href="https://email.geeks.chat"&gt;Email Geeks Community&lt;/a&gt;, but if you&amp;#8217;re new, let me break it down for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; came into effect, which put in place some rigorous laws around data processing and how personally identifiable information (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;) has to be handled. This stressed out a lot of email marketers, who quite rightly realised that the new regulations would have a significant effect on their ability to acquire and market to customers via their email address (which counts as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you&amp;#8217;re reading this, you&amp;#8217;re probably familiar with how that&amp;#8217;s gone, so I won&amp;#8217;t bore you with the&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So What&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;Problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of commercial email sent today contains tracking pixels and tracking links, these are used to uniquely identify individuals so that opens and clicks can be correctly attributed to them. This isn&amp;#8217;t strictly a problem, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; does not ban processing of personal data for tracking purposes, however email tracking frequently fails to meet a number of criteria necessary to be legal under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#8217;re not collection consent to track user behaviour&lt;/strong&gt; - That means we&amp;#8217;re probably relying on good old Legitimate Interest and that&amp;#8217;s frought with a number of&amp;nbsp;risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, most brands aren&amp;#8217;t disclosing in their privacy policies or at moment of signup that they&amp;#8217;re tracking user behaviour in marketing emails. That&amp;#8217;s a problem. &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/"&gt;Article 5&lt;/a&gt; clearly states that to be legally compliant, personal data should be processed in the following&amp;nbsp;manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and&amp;nbsp;transparency’);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is further expanded upon in &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-39/"&gt;Recital 39&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be&amp;nbsp;processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to adequately disclose email tracking within your brand&amp;#8217;s privacy policy is a clear breach of the&amp;nbsp;regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, when Legitimate Interest is used as the legal basis for processing of personal data, the data subject has the &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/"&gt;Right to Object&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those&amp;nbsp;provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that when processing data under a Legitimate Interest basis, the data subject has the right to object to your tracking, this brings us round to our second&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Email Marketing Platforms Are Not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Compliant&amp;#8224;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;, does it allow you to, on a per individual basis, opt-out of email&amp;nbsp;tracking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to that is no, and in most cases the answer will be no, you&amp;#8217;re in breach of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; as soon as a customer objects to your data processing. That is assuming you disclose the tracking in your privacy policy, if you don&amp;#8217;t you&amp;#8217;re already in&amp;nbsp;breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more of a legal quagmire as soon as we start looking at tracking in emails sent on a legal basis other than Consent or Legitimate&amp;nbsp;Interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you do about&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complain to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt; Complain frequently and loudly. Make them do something about it. Ultimately the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; is here to stay, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s must put in the work to allow marketers to comply with the&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Does That Leave Email&amp;nbsp;Marketing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email marketing isn&amp;#8217;t going anywhere, email remains one of the most valuable channels for reaching your customers and losing the ability to track behavioural data isn&amp;#8217;t going to change that fundamental fact. What is going to change is our ability to act upon vast swathes of personal&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not a problem, personal data is not a crucial part of gauging the success of a campaign and anonymised data is more than good enough for us to achieve our&amp;nbsp;objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll leave you with a parting note; as marketers, we&amp;#8217;ve become entirely too comfortable handling vast swathes of personal data, it&amp;#8217;s time we get used to a world where that option isn&amp;#8217;t always going to be available to&amp;nbsp;us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual caveats apply. I am not a&amp;nbsp;lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8224; &lt;em&gt;Yes, I know a small minority are, but they&amp;#8217;re a small minority. This might be one of the very few instances in which I&amp;#8217;d recommend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tough Mudder</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/tough-mudder.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-06T20:27:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-06T20:27:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-05-06:/writing/tough-mudder.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, it was&amp;nbsp;tough.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the London West Tough Mudder event with a great group of colleagues from Paymentsense, and, well, it was fucking freezing&amp;nbsp;🥶.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, my dodgy hip flexor played up so I had to pull out around mile 6. Felt like a serious bummer but I didn&amp;#8217;t want to push it so far I&amp;#8217;d be struggling to walk for the next month. You can see how I did over on the &lt;a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/3617216339"&gt;Garmin activity page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;ll be back next year, just need to sort this hip&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hello World</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/hello-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-06T13:37:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-06T13:37:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-05-06:/writing/hello-world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is this a blog? I think it might just&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;#8217;s been a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; time since I&amp;#8217;ve bothered to have a blog or personal site of any sort - and while I&amp;#8217;ve certainly dabbled in a bunch of web related projects over the years (mostly wikis and video game community related stuff), I&amp;#8217;ve not really &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; the web properly in a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this represents a new start of sorts. I&amp;#8217;m currently dabbling in Python in an effort to learn some new skills, so this site is being generated through &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python based static site generator. I&amp;#8217;m also experimenting with Github, something that seems trivial to most developers but I never got around to learning for no good reason at all. Site content is being hosted in an Azure blob, which is easy peasy through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I&amp;#8217;d like become more rounded as a marketer by being able to actually get stuck in with some of the more technical projects that I like being involved in. I guess I&amp;#8217;ll be posting some of my efforts about that here, along with whatever else takes my&amp;nbsp;fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for dropping&amp;nbsp;in!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
