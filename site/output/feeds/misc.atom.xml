&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/07/twitter-fesses-up-to-more-adtech-leaks/"&gt;Twitter ‘fesses up to more adtech&amp;nbsp;leaks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know you weren&amp;#8217;t asking but no, you still shouldn&amp;#8217;t trust big tech companies with your personal data. I hope regulatory bodies across Europe take leaf out of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s book and start to impose some hefty fines on companies that keep doing this to&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who&amp;#8217;s been to Brighton knows that seagulls are arseholes who&amp;#8217;ll swoop in and steal your bag of chips or doughnuts without a care in the world. Next time you find yourself face to beak with one of these rats of the coast, remember this sage&amp;nbsp;advice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The study suggests gulls find the human gaze terrifying—and that they take human behavior into account when trawling the city for meals. The researchers say changes in human behavior may save us a chip or two—and help guide more effective gull conservation efforts. So, next time a pesky gull tries to steal your food, don’t run away; try having a staring contest with it&amp;nbsp;instead.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/epic-store-rage-has-gotten-out-of-hand-1837008625"&gt;Epic Store Rage Has Gotten Out Of&amp;nbsp;Hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamers. Sigh. The latest scandal in gaming is apparently developers daring to sell the game they&amp;#8217;ve made through the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPIC&lt;/span&gt; game store instead of whatever other digital storefront. This is apparently &lt;em&gt;such&lt;/em&gt; an affront that exceedingly special members of the gaming community have decided it&amp;#8217;s worth sending death and rape threats to developers. If you want to understand the rise of the alt-right and some of the tactics they use, looking at events like this and Gamergate will help make things&amp;nbsp;clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.revolvermag.com/music/slipknot-darkness-anger-addiction-behind-iowa-we-almost-all-died"&gt;Slipknot on Darkness, Anger, Addiction Behind ‘Iowa’: “We Almost All&amp;nbsp;Died”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summer it was released, I spent weeks listening to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOWA&lt;/span&gt; by Slipknot on repeat while playing the Warhammer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUD&lt;/span&gt;, Wolfenburg. Anytime I hear it now, I get flashbacks to sitting at home staring at screens full of descriptive text, slowly typing my way to victory. This article was shared on the EmailGeeks slack by Waz and I immediately had to start listening to the album again, and yep, the flashbacks to that time were still in full&amp;nbsp;effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#8217;t a favourite of mine at the time by any means, but it&amp;#8217;s grown a lot on me and the stories the Slipknot crew tell about that time period are&amp;nbsp;fascinating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRAHAN&lt;/span&gt; Best time for me was when Sid was a little out of control, wouldn&amp;#8217;t get his shit down. He&amp;#8217;s like, &amp;#8220;I gotta go. My grandfather&amp;#8217;s dying. I gotta get there. Shit&amp;#8217;s going on.&amp;#8221; Grandpa dies. Didn&amp;#8217;t get there. Sid shows up. But we see he&amp;#8217;s hurting. He gets in [the recording booth]. They start the song. He starts singing. Next thing you know the song&amp;#8217;s done, he has a breakdown and that&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;(515)&amp;#8221; [the intro of Iowa]. That&amp;#8217;s all Sid. Just gone. I come in the next day, Ross is weeping. Puts his arms around me. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for you, Clown. You&amp;#8217;re one of the few people that&amp;#8217;s gonna understand this. This is my favorite part of the record. It&amp;#8217;s the realest part of the record.&amp;#8221; It was Sid having a breakdown from all the pain in this thing called&amp;nbsp;Slipknot.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/deepminds-latest-a-i-health-breakthrough-has-some-problems-5cd14e2c77ef"&gt;DeepMind’s Latest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A.I.&lt;/span&gt; Health Breakthrough Has Some&amp;nbsp;Problems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;#8217;t you know, there are some deep flaws with Deepmind&amp;#8217;s health research. Unsurprisingly, feeding an algorithm gender biased data results in a gender biased model. Quelle surprise&amp;nbsp;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Google machine learning company trumpeted its success in predicting a deadly kidney condition, but its results raise questions around data rights and patient&amp;nbsp;diversity&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Profitwell always turn out excellent research, this is the latest example of that. If you&amp;#8217;re selling a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAAS&lt;/span&gt; product and want to learn something, read this.

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://qz.com/1680926/what-makes-nationalism-so-successful/"&gt;Nationalism is thriving using the very mechanism it&amp;nbsp;denounces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another day, another hate crime perpetrated by an Angry White Man.  If you want to begin to understand what drives nationalism and fascism around the world, this article is well worth your&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;In July, the head of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, Ali Erbas, declared that same-sex relationships constituted “heresy.” This is the same institution that in 2018 claimed on their website that girls as young as nine years old were spiritually ready to get married. One out of every three marriages in the country today involves underage girls, according to women’s rights groups. Cases of gender-based violence in Turkey escalated by 1,400% from 2002 to&amp;nbsp;2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I site Turkey because it gives us a salient example of how populist nationalism—and its next-in-line, populist authoritarianism—not only generates nativism and a systematic distrust of foreigners, but exacerbates sexism, misogyny and&amp;nbsp;homophobia.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://qz.com/work/1675000/how-to-achieve-a-big-career-goal-start-by-keeping-a-work-diary/"&gt;If you’ve got a big career goal, you need to start keeping a work&amp;nbsp;diary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate writing, I don&amp;#8217;t feel good at it and it feels like, at any moment, someone will realise I&amp;#8217;m as dumb as I sometimes feel I am. This article was a good kick in the arse for me to just get on with it and worry about it&amp;nbsp;later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Personal growth is perhaps the most important outcome of keeping a work diary, according to Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile and psychologist Steven Kramer, co-authors of the book The Progress Principle. As they explain in an article for the Harvard Business Review, they asked more than 200 knowledge workers to write in a diary for no more than 10 minutes a day while working on a complex project. While the participants said the exercise helped them stay focused and organized, they were especially struck by the psychological revelations that occurred to them as they&amp;nbsp;wrote.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/us/politics/trump-campaign-facebook-ads-invasion.html"&gt;How the Trump Campaign Used Facebook Ads to Amplify His ‘Invasion’&amp;nbsp;Claim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#8217;t been paying attention, America&amp;#8217;s got a white supremacy problem. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s got the lowdown on how Trump&amp;#8217;s inflammatory language has been used across more than 2,000 ads on Facebook and why that&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/ars-forensic-files-how-to-parse-through-e-mail-headers-and-spot-obfuscation/"&gt;What all the stuff in email headers means—and how to sniff out&amp;nbsp;spoofing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite working in email for the last 8 years, I still struggle to read email headers. This article is probably the best thing I&amp;#8217;ve read on the subject, hugely informative if you want to help others understand just why email is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sonniesedge.net/posts/real-dark-web/"&gt;The Real Dark&amp;nbsp;Web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;#8217;re active in online communities, particularly technical ones, it&amp;#8217;s easy to get wrapped up in the idea that everyone&amp;#8217;s doing the latest thing, this is as true in web design as it is in email&amp;nbsp;marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;They are the 99% of the web universe that is quietly getting on, not blogging about their technology stack, not publishing amazing new tooling. Simply building&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call them the 1% with purpose, in a deliberate evocation of the privileged 1% who run our planet (because I love to jump analogy mid post and to distort numbers). To be on a cutting edge team is a privilege. It means having resources and money and a lack of accountability that most web developers simply don&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;have.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I recall watching the race with my dad in our sitting room in France, he was home from the hospital after a heavy bout of chemo and the loss of one of his heroes bought him to tears. A few months later, in December, he died&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Close to 25 years later, a few weeks ago, his father passed away. In many ways, he was the father I never really had the luxury of having, pushing me into various sports, teaching me to read a clock, to speak to strangers and so much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to see the rise of hateful father figures in society like Jordan Peterson. Cheerily leading vulnerable young white men towards paths of intolerance and hatred for others in the name of a quick buck. When simple advice like “clean your room” gets passed alongside race baiting &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/02/the-unwelcome-revival-of-race-science"&gt;“Race &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IQ&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/a&gt; lies and society turns inwards and backwards, sparking intolerance and attacks towards women, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LGBTQ&lt;/span&gt;+ community and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are we to do with all the angry young white&amp;nbsp;men?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you reading this might have seen me talk about this problem in the very excellent &lt;a href="https://email.geeks.chat"&gt;Email Geeks Community&lt;/a&gt;, but if you&amp;#8217;re new, let me break it down for&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; came into effect, which put in place some rigorous laws around data processing and how personally identifiable information (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;) has to be handled. This stressed out a lot of email marketers, who quite rightly realised that the new regulations would have a significant effect on their ability to acquire and market to customers via their email address (which counts as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PII&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you&amp;#8217;re reading this, you&amp;#8217;re probably familiar with how that&amp;#8217;s gone, so I won&amp;#8217;t bore you with the&amp;nbsp;details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So What&amp;#8217;s the&amp;nbsp;Problem?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of commercial email sent today contains tracking pixels and tracking links, these are used to uniquely identify individuals so that opens and clicks can be correctly attributed to them. This isn&amp;#8217;t strictly a problem, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; does not ban processing of personal data for tracking purposes, however email tracking frequently fails to meet a number of criteria necessary to be legal under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#8217;re not collection consent to track user behaviour&lt;/strong&gt; - That means we&amp;#8217;re probably relying on good old Legitimate Interest and that&amp;#8217;s frought with a number of&amp;nbsp;risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, most brands aren&amp;#8217;t disclosing in their privacy policies or at moment of signup that they&amp;#8217;re tracking user behaviour in marketing emails. That&amp;#8217;s a problem. &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-5-gdpr/"&gt;Article 5&lt;/a&gt; clearly states that to be legally compliant, personal data should be processed in the following&amp;nbsp;manner:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and&amp;nbsp;transparency’);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is further expanded upon in &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-39/"&gt;Recital 39&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be&amp;nbsp;processed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to adequately disclose email tracking within your brand&amp;#8217;s privacy policy is a clear breach of the&amp;nbsp;regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, when Legitimate Interest is used as the legal basis for processing of personal data, the data subject has the &lt;a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-21-gdpr/"&gt;Right to Object&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those&amp;nbsp;provisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that when processing data under a Legitimate Interest basis, the data subject has the right to object to your tracking, this brings us round to our second&amp;nbsp;problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Email Marketing Platforms Are Not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Compliant&amp;#8224;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;, does it allow you to, on a per individual basis, opt-out of email&amp;nbsp;tracking?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the answer to that is no, and in most cases the answer will be no, you&amp;#8217;re in breach of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; as soon as a customer objects to your data processing. That is assuming you disclose the tracking in your privacy policy, if you don&amp;#8217;t you&amp;#8217;re already in&amp;nbsp;breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This becomes even more of a legal quagmire as soon as we start looking at tracking in emails sent on a legal basis other than Consent or Legitimate&amp;nbsp;Interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what can you do about&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complain to your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt; Complain frequently and loudly. Make them do something about it. Ultimately the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GDPR&lt;/span&gt; is here to stay, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s must put in the work to allow marketers to comply with the&amp;nbsp;law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where Does That Leave Email&amp;nbsp;Marketing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email marketing isn&amp;#8217;t going anywhere, email remains one of the most valuable channels for reaching your customers and losing the ability to track behavioural data isn&amp;#8217;t going to change that fundamental fact. What is going to change is our ability to act upon vast swathes of personal&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know&amp;nbsp;what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not a problem, personal data is not a crucial part of gauging the success of a campaign and anonymised data is more than good enough for us to achieve our&amp;nbsp;objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll leave you with a parting note; as marketers, we&amp;#8217;ve become entirely too comfortable handling vast swathes of personal data, it&amp;#8217;s time we get used to a world where that option isn&amp;#8217;t always going to be available to&amp;nbsp;us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usual caveats apply. I am not a&amp;nbsp;lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8224; &lt;em&gt;Yes, I know a small minority are, but they&amp;#8217;re a small minority. This might be one of the very few instances in which I&amp;#8217;d recommend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SFMC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Tough Mudder</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/tough-mudder.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-06T20:27:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-06T20:27:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-05-06:/writing/tough-mudder.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert, it was&amp;nbsp;tough.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday I attended the London West Tough Mudder event with a great group of colleagues from Paymentsense, and, well, it was fucking freezing&amp;nbsp;🥶.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, my dodgy hip flexor played up so I had to pull out around mile 6. Felt like a serious bummer but I didn&amp;#8217;t want to push it so far I&amp;#8217;d be struggling to walk for the next month. You can see how I did over on the &lt;a href="https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/3617216339"&gt;Garmin activity page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;#8217;ll be back next year, just need to sort this hip&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hello World</title><link href="https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/hello-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-05-06T13:37:00+01:00</published><updated>2019-05-06T13:37:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Jacques Corby-Tuech</name></author><id>tag:www.jacquescorbytuech.com,2019-05-06:/writing/hello-world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Is this a blog? I think it might just&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;#8217;s been a &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; time since I&amp;#8217;ve bothered to have a blog or personal site of any sort - and while I&amp;#8217;ve certainly dabbled in a bunch of web related projects over the years (mostly wikis and video game community related stuff), I&amp;#8217;ve not really &lt;em&gt;done&lt;/em&gt; the web properly in a long&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this represents a new start of sorts. I&amp;#8217;m currently dabbling in Python in an effort to learn some new skills, so this site is being generated through &lt;a href="https://blog.getpelican.com" title="Pelican"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;, a Python based static site generator. I&amp;#8217;m also experimenting with Github, something that seems trivial to most developers but I never got around to learning for no good reason at all. Site content is being hosted in an Azure blob, which is easy peasy through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I&amp;#8217;d like become more rounded as a marketer by being able to actually get stuck in with some of the more technical projects that I like being involved in. I guess I&amp;#8217;ll be posting some of my efforts about that here, along with whatever else takes my&amp;nbsp;fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for dropping&amp;nbsp;in!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
