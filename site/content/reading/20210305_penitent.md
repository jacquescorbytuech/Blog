The first book in this trilogy, Pariah, was released back in 2012 and itself follows from the Ravenor and Einsenhorn trilogies, the latter of which is apparently getting the [tv treatment](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10656018/).

Given the *long* wait between this and the last instalment, I sort of forgot about the series until I started seeing spoilers popping up everywhere. And given some of those spoilers I didn't really have much of a choice to put down the other book I was reading[^1] and immediately jump onto this one.

Without giving anything away, this was an ace read and I *really* hope I don't have another 8 year wait until the next instalment. 

Dan Abnett has absolutely smashed it out of the park. Again.
