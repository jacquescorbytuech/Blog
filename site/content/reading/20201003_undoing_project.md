Michael Lewis is an exceptional storyteller and *The Undoing Project* is no exception. This is a deftly written story about how an exceptional collaboration and friendship sprung between Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Two psychologists who changed the world with their discoveries on human decision making.

The Undoing Project doesn't tell you much about the heuristics discovered by Kahneman and Tversky, if you're interested in those you should go read [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/thinking-fast-and-slow). Either way, this is a great story and one well worth reading if you're interested in understanding how this incredible work came about.
