If you're not familiar with Bob Hoffman, he's built a brand as [The Ad Contrarian](https://twitter.com/adcontrarian) - which should tell you everything you need to know about why I enjoyed this book.

Through a no bullshit approach, Hoffman breaks down many of the delusions marketers and advertisers like to parrot to one another.

**No**, people don't want to *[join the conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YvlqiJwGe8)* about your brand.

**No**, digital marketing doesn't change the fundamental truths in marketing.

**No**, a click isn't a meaningful metric.

**No**, millenials aren't special.

And many more...

If you've read [Hoffman's blog](http://adcontrarian.blogspot.com/) before you've likely read many of the short chapters from this book, but this absolutely belongs on your desk or your bookshelf when you need a break from the bullshit you hear all too often around the office.
