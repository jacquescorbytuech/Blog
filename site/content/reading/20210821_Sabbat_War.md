I've been reading Dan Abnett's *Gaunt's Ghosts* series for well over a decade now, so it's always surprising when a new book comes out. This one's an anthology of stories set in the Sabbat Worlds but does great work to flesh out some of the more hidden parts of the story. Armaduke by John French was a particular highlight for me.
