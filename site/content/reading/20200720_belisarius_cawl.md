*Belisarius Cawl* was a fun read that introduces some of the key new characters in the post Dark Imperium timeline of 40k.

There are some clear nods to what we know now to be happening with 9th edition and some closure for readers of the Horus Heresy series.

A great read for anyone wanting to understand recent 40k lore.
