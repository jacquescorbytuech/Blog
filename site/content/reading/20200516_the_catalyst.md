This one was sort of a cross between [Never Split the Difference](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/never-split-the-difference.html) and [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/thinking-fast-and-slow.html), without being as good as either of those books.

Nevertheless, this wasn't awful by any means. Berger breaks down the actions of a change catalyst through what he calls the **REDUCE** framework.

* **Reactance** - when pushed, people will push back. When trying to persuade change, encourage people by giving them the space to convince themselves.
* **Endowment** - The classic Endowment Effect[^Endowment]. Catalysts counter this by surfacing the costs of inaction and by showing people that inaction has a cost.
* **Distance** -  People can't be pushed too far, find their *Zone of Acceptance* and work within it.
* **Uncertainty** - Uncertainty is the enemy of change, lower the barrier to entry by introducing a freemium model, for example.
* **Corroborating Evidence** - Use as many sources as you can to further prove your point

Worth a read if you enjoyed the books I mentioned previously, but there's nothing life-changing to learn here.
