No big deal, just the ~155th Warhammer book I've read* according to Goodreads.

This one was actually surprisingly fun, set on Terra (grimdark Earth, duh) featuring a mad plot to stop the Emperor being a perpetual vegetable. Featuring a not so surprise appearance from Henry Cavill's chosen faction, the Custodes. I guess you need to be a movie star to [afford these shiny bois](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Fury-of-Terra-Shield-Host-2018).

Inquisitor stories are always a good read.

**I am very cool*
