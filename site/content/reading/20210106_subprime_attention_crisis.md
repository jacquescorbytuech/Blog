This is a short book, but it doesn't mince it's words and lays a compelling case that digital programmatic advertising is in a cataclysmic bubble.

For better or worse, the modern internet was built off the back of advertising. We rely on advertising subsidised services every day and a violent bursting of the bubble could well cause serious collatoral damage.

There's hope, though. Increasing awareness of the side-effects of advertising are [readily apparent](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/the-age-of-surveillance-capitalism) and I hope marketers are starting to woke up and realise that the opaque system they use are full of [garbage data](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/marketers-addicted-bad-data), if not [outright fraud](https://www.mql.fm/002-60-million-60-billion-ad-fraud-question-augustine-fou).

If you've read about the cause of the '08 crisis none of this will sound unfamiliar to you. There's no excuse for modern marketers to not be aware of the risks being outlined by *Tim Hwang*.
