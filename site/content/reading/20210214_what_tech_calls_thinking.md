This is another book by FSGO x Logic, along with [Subprime Attention Crisis](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/subprime-attention-crisis), and a few others sitting in my to-read pile.

Adrian Daub break down common Silicon Valley intellectual golden geese, the college dropout, failure, the idea of the tech *genius*, disruption and more. These concepts are explored and linked to Silicon Valley leaders like Mark Zuckerberg, Elizabeth Holmes (of Theranos infamy), Peter Thiel and more. There are some pretty spectacular takedowns of common SV truisms, showing just how shallow core tenets of SV thought leadership tend to be.
