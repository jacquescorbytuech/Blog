Aaron Dembski-Bowden's one of the better authors writing for Games Workshop's Black Library. Yep, that's as nerdy as it sounds.

*Black Legion* didn't disappoint, following on from [The Talon of Horus](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20191125-weekly-reading.html) which I finished late last year, the book continues the plot and tells the story of the Black Legion's founding.

For those who aren't massive nerds, the Black Legion are 40k's *bad guys*, led by this [angry looking fella](https://www.games-workshop.com/en-GB/Abaddon-the-Despoiler-2019). Despite being about the bad guys, the writing is fun and engaging in ways few other 40k books can match.

A fun reads for fans of the franchise, and quite possibly one of the better entry points into the story if you're interested in understanding what 40k is all about. Certainly a better entry point than the never ending Horus Heresy series.
