Part detective story, part body horror, *Flesh and Steel* was a really fun read. Warhammer's Crime imprint is quickly becoming one of my favourite things they're publishing and this one really set the bar high. 

Set on the same world as [Bloodlines](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/bloodlines) though the characters couldn't be any further apart. I'd highly recommend this to anyone unfamiliar with the 40k setting.
