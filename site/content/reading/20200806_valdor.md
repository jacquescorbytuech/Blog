Not going to lie, I'll probably have to re-read this sooner rather than later. I was reading this while getting my legs tattooed, getting your knee ditch coloured is not conducive to concentration.

Set in pre-unity Terra, *Valdor* introduces some fascinating glimpses of events that've only ever been alluded to in other books.

There's a tremendous amount of depth to the virtual worlds that Games Workshop have created, I just hope we get to see more from this interesting time period in the setting.
