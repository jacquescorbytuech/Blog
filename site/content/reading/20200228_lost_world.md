I read the first Jurassic Park in Morocco a couple years ago and thought it was a perfect holiday read.

This one isn't much different - the story is quite different from the movie but altogether, I think it's quite a bit better. This isn't an intellectual read by any stretch of the imagination, and I think it's a book I would have loved if I'd read it in my early teens. Oh well, guess I'll read it in my 30's instead.

There was a sequel of sorts released as a videogame, this [Let's Play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6A3SaRr26M&list=PL0058A651EB882B48) from Research Indicates is absolutely fascinating if you need more dinos in your life.

*People getting eaten by velociraptors and t-rexes is always entertaining.*
