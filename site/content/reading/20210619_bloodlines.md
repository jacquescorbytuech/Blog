I'm partial to a crime novel and finally found the time to dip my toes into the 40k crime imprint that've recently been released.

Bloodlines was really fun, the 40k setting was there providing some familiar backdrop but never feeling like it took over the story. I've since bought some of the other novels and can't wait to get stuck into them.

If you enjoyed Richard Morgan's Black Man or R. Scott Bakker's Disciple of the Dog you'll find a lot to like here, whether you're into 40k or not.
