This one crept up on me as I wasn't expecting to read it so soon, but I'm glad it did. I've been reading and collecting the Malazan series since my late teens and it continues to be an absolute treat.

*The God is Not Willing* follows on from Erikson's Malazan Book of the Fallen series and the writing style should be familar to anyone who managed to make it through those. It's often easy to characterise a lot of Erikson's work around real-world issues, and fundamentally, this is about global warming.

It's at times hamfisted and heavy handed but enjoyable nevertheless.
