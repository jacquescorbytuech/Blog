This is book #2 in the *Siege of Terra* offshoot from the Horus Heresy series.

I've been reading these books for well over a decade, the end is *almost* in sight and various plot strings are all starting to come together.

I don't have a ton to say about this one really, read if it you've read the rest, if you haven't there are ~60 books you should be reading before you get this one.

More of the same, but not in a bad way.
