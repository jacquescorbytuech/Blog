**Do you feel like modern marketing is full of bullshit?** *Delusions of Brandeur* is the cure to that. In a short (I read it in a couple hours) package, this proves to be a pithy antidote to the overwhelming amounts of shit we're inundated under on a daily basis.

If you follow [Ryan's Twitter](https://twitter.com/Dr_Draper) you've probably already read a significant chunk of this book. Don't let that deter you, it's worth keeping on your desk and handing to a colleague when they start veering off into bullshit land.
