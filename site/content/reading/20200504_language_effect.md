I love what the pholk are Phrasee are doing so had to pick this up.

This then is Parry's call to arms for writers to join the technological revolution and make use of new tools to improve their work, much like VisiCalc did for accountants in '79 and Photoshop did for the creative industry in '90.

It's hard to argue with the premise of the book, copywriting is hard and machines are more than already capable of doing a better job than the average writer. *I consider myself significantly below average so I'll take any help I can get.*

I can't wait to see what Phrasee does next.
