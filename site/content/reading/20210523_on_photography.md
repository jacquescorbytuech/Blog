A long and at-times rambling essay on the impact of photography on art and society. The role photography played in society when this was first published in 1973 has changed quite dramatically. It would be fascinating to hear Sontag's take on how the medium has evolved and how society has evolved with it. 

> Photographs cannot create a moral position, but they can reinforce one-and can help build a nascent one.
