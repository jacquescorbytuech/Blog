*A Little Hatred* follows on from Abercrombie's [First Law](https://www.goodreads.com/series/150214-first-law-world) series which I loved when I started reading them in my late teens.

Despite being a fantasy novel, it's great to see Abercrombie explore issues that feel particularly relevant to the current world we find ourselves in, with sexism and racism being widely explored.

> Funny how, whenever men talked about freedom, they never really meant for the women.

The world of A Little Hatred finds itself in the middle of an industrial revolution, with strong echoes of Victorian workhouses, smog laden cities and all the wealth inequality you'd expect to see from a rapidly industrialising society.

Tons of fun to read and well worth picking up if you enjoyed Abercrombie's earlier work.
