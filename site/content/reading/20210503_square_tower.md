A really interesting concept, poorly executed. *The Square and the Tower* is supposed to be about the dynamic between hierarchies and networks and how these dynamics have affected historic events. It's unfortunate, then, that *Ferguson* does a poor job of explaining this in any meaningful way. No effort is made to hide his political leanings towards the end, leading to tedious bashing of [Naomi Klein](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/no-logo) and blaming "Liberals" for many of modern society's failings.

This had so much potential. Alas.
