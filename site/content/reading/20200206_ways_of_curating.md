Curating seems to have lost it's meaning in recent years, everyone is curating a blog, a social feed, a podcast, a blog, whatever.

*Ways of Curating* is about art curation, but mostly it's about building relationships. Relationships between artists, between people, and the impact that exhibitions can go on to have to people around the world.
