Book #3 in the *Siege of Terra* series, following on from [The Lost and the Damned](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/lost-damned) which I read earlier this year.

I don't really have much to say here, like the rest of the series this was a fun read that seems to be taking the story (for which we already know the end) in the right direction. 

I've heard good things about book #4 *Saturnine*, which should be released sometime next month.
