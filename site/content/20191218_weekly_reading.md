Keeping this short because I am *busy* at the moment and I should probably do a nice big yearly roundup at some point in the very near future.

I had the pleasure (ðŸ™ƒ) of [getting tattooed](https://twitter.com/iamacyborg/status/1206192759431991297) again on Sunday so I powered through [Trillion Dollar Coach](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43445551-trillion-dollar-coach) by Eric Schmidt, Jonathan Rosenberg and Alan Eagle. By all accounts, Bill Campbell was an incredible man who coached high powered execs to incredible levels of success. Trillion Dollar Coach opens by stating that The Coach wouldn't have wanted a book written about him, Schmit *et al.* should have had more respect for him and not published something this dull.
