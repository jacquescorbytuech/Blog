Summary: Better late than never?

This week's been pretty productive on the book reading front, I quickly worked my way through Orwell's [Why I Write](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24104049-why-i-write) which was fascinating, albeit the British stereotyping quickly became tiresome. I found it interesting to compare Orwell's views on British and European values and the rise of fascism across Europe - things that worryingly have been on the rise in recent years.

I first came across Yanis Varoufakis' work back when he [worked at Valve](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/economics/), the video game company (back when they still made games) and thoroughly enjoyed the few blogs he posted there. So when I was browsing the Economics section of Waterstones I was drawn to his book, [A Brief History of Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39808472-talking-to-my-daughter). I know next to nothing in economics, so this was precisely the dumbed down view I needed to dip my toe into the subject.

I've heard and read a lot about Eric Ries' [Lean Startup](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12969026-the-lean-startup) in the last few years, so it provided some interesting and rather light reading when I was abroad in Granada. I'm working on a lil' something something so there was a lot to take away from this, particularly around the value of quickly developing and testing an MVP, something I hope to have done by the end of the year ðŸ‘€

Finally, I'm now reading Scott Galloway's [The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36166396-the-four). More thoughts to follow next week.

Profitwell continue to bring out some of the most well-researched and produced content out there, and [this piece on discounting](https://www.profitwell.com/blog/how-do-discounts-impact-growth) certainly didn't disappoint.

> Discounts are one of the worst tactics you can use to grow your business, because like a virus theyâ€™re a ticking time bomb for your growth.

Despite what you've read elsewhere, and what you're probably thinking, [medieval people bathed](https://going-medieval.com/2019/08/02/i-assure-you-medieval-people-bathed/), as Dr Eleanor Janega explains quite authoritatively. Not quite the smelly peasants we think about, eh?

This is something I'm sure a lot of people working in tech have come across, but what actually are product teams? Marty Cagan puts together a compelling case to explain the difference between [product and feature teams](https://svpg.com/product-vs-feature-teams/).

There was a great article in the [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/16/superfans-a-love-story) on what modern fandom means and how it came to be. Not going to lie, superfans weird me out.

[Boris is trying to fuck us](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexspence/boris-johnson-dominic-cummings-voter-data). Is the ICO going to come to our [rescue](https://twitter.com/ICOnews/status/1172085036012711936)?

We've all come across poorly implemented browser Push notifications, but it doesn't have to be that way Stephanie Walker wrote the perfect guide on [how to not fuck up push notifications](https://stephaniewalter.design/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-not-fck-up-push-notifications/). Speaking anecdotally, my team at DM Companies implemented these on one of the sites we worked on. For our use case, we saw a consistent uplift vs the same message delivered via email. This is absolutely a channel that can work dramatically well, just be responsible with it, duh.

Bit short this week huh? I spent a long weekend in Granada - the Alhambra is fucking incredible. Get your head away from your screen and go visit sometime.
