Progress made so far on [Traction](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25768015-traction). Zero. It appears I've fallen off the wagon on that front. I'll pick it back up during the week.

[Obvious UI is often the best UI](https://medium.com/google-design/the-obvious-ui-is-often-the-best-ui-7a25597d79fd), it seems like a pretty self-evident statement but sometimes we all need reminding of the obvious. Why hide your navigation under a hamburger menu when you can display it directly? Why not show a bottom navigation bar on mobile screens so the navigation is in easy reach for a user? Maybe we need to go back to the drawing board and get back to the basics.

What is the IndieWeb and why should you care? [Jamie Tanna tells us what it's all about](https://www.jvt.me/posts/2019/10/20/indieweb-talk/). The web has changed significantly in the last couple decades - and people are starting to fight back against the lack of ownership of their own content and data.

Google Stadia - Google's videogame streaming service that allows users to play games streamed directly from Google servers is launching in less than a month, but [you've probably heard nothing about it](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-25-stadias-stealth-launch-does-not-inspire-confidence-opinion). Can we expect this to be as big a flop as all the other similar programs that launched over the last few years?

Funerals aren't normally very fun affairs - [this one might have been different](https://www.dw.com/en/german-restaurant-mistakenly-serves-cannabis-cake-at-funeral/a-51038232).

Web dev has changed significantly from when I learnt it at uni and the radical shift towards Javascript as a monolithic environment is one that I still struggle to wrap my head around. [Is there still value](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06) in just knowing how to write good CSS and HTML, I firmly believe the answer is yes.

On that note, and related to the shortness of this post, I've been working on something [along these lines](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/decoupled-drupal-getting-started-gatsby-and-jsonapi), very much more to talk about in the near future.
