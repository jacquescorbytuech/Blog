Another fun one by Aaron Demski-Bowden. *Spear of the Emperor* is set in the advanced 40k setting in what's now known as Imperium Nihilus. As usual with stuff from Black Library, it's a fun, action-packed read that fleshes out some of the lore for the new setting.

Read it for the fun story and the insight into the Celestion Lions chapter, if that's your sorta thing.
