This is the final book in the Dark Imperium trilogy, following on from Dark Imperium and [Plague War](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/writing/20191230-weekly-reading.html).

There's a lot here that I think fans of 40k will enjoy, in particular it seems like this is setting the scene for some interesting future events, particularly with the [Pariah series](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/penitent) and the final events of the [Siege of Terra](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/saturnine).

One that I think fans of 40k should read, but this book (or even trilogy) won't be a good intro into 40k for the more casual reader.
