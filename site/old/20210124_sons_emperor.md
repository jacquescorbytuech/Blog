Another anthology, collecting 8 short stories about the Primarchs. This one is a little better than [Scions of the Emperor](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/scions-of-the-emperor), with *Shadow of the Past* by Gav Thorpe being a particular highlight.

Another one to read only if you're already neck-deep in the wider Horus Heresy series.
