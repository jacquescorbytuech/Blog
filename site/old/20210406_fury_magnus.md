The end of the arc that started with *A Thousand Sons* way back in 2010.

The story was quite gripping at times and frustrating at others. We all (at least, those of us that are familiar with 40k) know how the story is going to end, but the twists and turns in the process are incredibly compelling.

Really enjoyed this one.
