A collected anthology of 8 short stories set in the Horus Heresy timeline. Nothing earth shattering but some interesting titbits of lore that existing 30k fans will enjoy. *First Legion* by Chris Wraight was perhaps my favourite as any lore around the Rangdan Xenocide is so scant that it was interesting to see a story set within that period.
