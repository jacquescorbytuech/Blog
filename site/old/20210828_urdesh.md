This was my first time reading something by *Matthew Farrer* and I was pleasantly surprised. Urdesh is set in the same microcosm as Abnett's [Gaunt's Ghosts](https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/sabbat-war) series and offers an interesting alternative viewpoint to the action that takes place in those more familiar books. A fun easy read.
