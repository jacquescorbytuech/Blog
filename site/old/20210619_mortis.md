The next instalment in the Siege of Terra series, following on from the events in (https://www.jacquescorbytuech.com/reading/saturnine).

*Slowly* but surely, over this massive series, the threads are being drawn together and the story is coming to an end. This is probably my favourite of the SoT books so far.
