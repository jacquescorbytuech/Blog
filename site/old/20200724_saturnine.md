*Saturnine* is one of the best books in the wider Horus Heresy series, ranking right up there with [Master of Mankind](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33303512-the-master-of-mankind), [Betrayer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13632835-betrayer) and [Know no Fear](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11797636-know-no-fear). I couldn't put it down.
