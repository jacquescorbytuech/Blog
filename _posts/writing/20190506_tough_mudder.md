Summary: Spoiler alert, it was tough.

Last Saturday I attended the London West Tough Mudder event with a great group of colleagues from Paymentsense, and, well, it was fucking freezing ðŸ¥¶.

Sadly, my dodgy hip flexor played up so I had to pull out around mile 6. Felt like a serious bummer but I didn't want to push it so far I'd be struggling to walk for the next month. You can see how I did over on the [Garmin activity page](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/activity/3617216339).

I think I'll be back next year, just need to sort this hip out.
